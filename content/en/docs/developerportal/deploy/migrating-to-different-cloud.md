## 1 Introduction

This document explains how to migrate your licensed app from one Mendix public cloud datacenter to another.

## 2 Migration Considerations

{{% alert color="warning" %}}
Do not upgrade your runtime version at the same time as migrating your app. This is because potential errors from upgrading the runtime version can be incorrectly ascribed to a failed migration. If you do choose to upgrade your runtime version at the same time as migrating your app, Mendix Support will not be able to assist you.

If you need to upgrade your runtime version, ensure that it is fully tested and ready before attempting to migrate.
{{% /alert %}}

Take the following into account when migrating your app:

* If you use a mail server from your app, you will need to use a third-party email provider â€“ for more information, see [Sending Email](/developerportal/deploy/sending-email/)
* If you use an FTP server in your app, you will need to use a third-party FTP provider
* If you are currently using a VPN to secure your app, you will have to use one of the recommended methods discussed in [Securing Outgoing Connections from Your Application](/developerportal/deploy/securing-outgoing-connections-from-your-application/) instead

## 3 Migrating the App

To manually migrate your app to a different node in the Mendix Cloud, follow the steps in the sections below.

### 3.1 Requesting the Target Cloud Node

Start the migration by opening a request with Mendix Support. Our support team will then provision a new cloud node for your app.

1. Submit a migration request to [Mendix Support](https://support.mendix.com/).
2. In the title of the request, mention that it concerns app migration.
3. Include the following information with the request:
    * *Project ID* - A unique identifier of your app
    * *Environment ID* - A unique identifier of an environment that you want to migrate
    
    You can find the required information by checking the **General** tab of the [Environment Details](/developerportal/deploy/environments-details/) page for your app.

4. In the Developer Portal, create an empty temporary app.
5. Request the target cloud node in the required datacenter through the [Request New App Node](https://newnode.mendix.com/) app.
6. After the Mendix Support team provisions a new cloud node for you, ensure that you have the [Technical Contact](/developerportal/collaborate/app-roles/#technical-contact) role for both your cloud nodes.

### 3.2 Linking the Temporary App to the Target Cloud Node

Connect the temporary app that you created to the target node.

1. In the [Developer Portal](http://sprintr.home.mendix.com), click **Apps**, and then click on the temporary app that you created.
2. In the app, in the **Deploy** section of the left navigation pane, click **Environments**.
3. Click **Select a node**.

    {{< figure src="/attachments/developerportal/deploy/migrating-to-v4/select-node.png" alt="The Select a node option on the Environments page" >}}

4. Select the target node by clicking **Use this Node**, and link it to your app.

For more information on how to do this, see [Licensing Mendix Cloud Apps](/developerportal/deploy/licensing-apps/#licensed-node).

### 3.3 Copying the Deployment Package and Data from the Source Node to the Target Node

Before migrating, you need to deploy a copy of your app to the target node. You can then copy the data from the source node to the target node. After copying the data, you should test the app, and correct errors if needed. Repeat this until all the errors are solved.

The following steps explain how to do this.

#### 3.3.1 Downloading and Uploading the Deployment Package

Download the deployment package of your app hosted in the source node, and then upload the deployment package to the app hosted in the target node by doing the following steps:

1. Go to **Environments** page of the source app.
2. On the **Deploy** tab, in the **Deployment Package Repository** section, click the **Details** button by the deployment package that you want to download.
3. Click **Download Package**.

    {{< figure src="/attachments/developerportal/deploy/migrating-to-v4/download-package.png" alt="Downloading a deployment package" >}}

4. Go to **Environments** page of the target app.
5. On the **Deploy** tab, in the **Deployment Package Repository** section, click **Upload**.

    {{< figure src="/attachments/developerportal/deploy/migrating-to-v4/upload-package.png" alt="Uploading a deployment package" >}}

6. Select the deployment package that you downloaded from your source app.
7. After uploading the package, click **Deploy**, and ensure that the package is deployed.
8. [Stop the app](/developerportal/deploy/private-cloud-deploy/#environment-details) so that you can upload the backup data.

#### 3.3.2 Transferring Your Backup Data

{{% alert color="info" %}}
Ensure you have performed the last two steps in the previous section to deploy your deployment package before continuing. Making a deployment prepares the environment and ensures your data is restored to the correct locations.
{{% /alert %}}

Transfer the backup data from the source app to the target app by following these steps:

1. Download a backup from your source app (for details, see [How to Download a Backup](/developerportal/operate/download-backup/)).

    {{% alert color="info" %}}It is recommended that you download copies of all backups that you want to keep. Once you have offboarded the old environment, they will no longer be available.{{% /alert %}}

2. Upload the downloaded backup to your app hosted in the target node (for details, see [How to Restore a Backup](/developerportal/operate/restore-backup/)).

#### 3.3.3 Configuring the New App

Before starting your app in the target node, make sure it has the same configuration as the source node. You can find the node settings on the [Environment Details](/developerportal/deploy/environments-details/) page under **Model Options**, **Network**, **Runtime**, and **Maintenance**.

#### 3.3.4 Testing and Repeating

Now that the target app contains your data and is configured, deploy the deployment package to an environment and start your app.

To learn how to do this, see [How to Deploy the App to an Environment](/developerportal/deploy/mendix-cloud-deploy/#deploy-the-app-to-an-environment).

### 3.4 Unlink the App from the Source Node

It is not possible to explicitly unlink an app from a licensed node. The only way to do this is to connect another app to the licensed node; this will unlink the existing app automatically. To do this, perform the following steps.

1. In the [Developer Portal](http://sprintr.home.mendix.com), go to **Apps** and select the second blank app you created (not the one you have linked to the target node).

2. Once you are in the app, go to the **Environments** tab in the left menu.

3. Click **select a node**.

4. Select the source node containing your app by clicking **Use this Node**, and link it to your app. Your app which is currently deployed to this node will be unlinked automatically and you can now link it to the target node.

A more detailed example of how this works given in the [Exchanging Linked Apps Between Nodes](/developerportal/deploy/licensing-apps/#exchange-apps) section of *Licensing Mendix Cloud Apps*.

### 3.5 Linking the App to the Target Node

Follow these steps to link the app you detached from the source node, above, to the target node:

{{% alert color="warning" %}}
Make sure you have downloaded the latest backup and deployment package before linking your app to the target node.
{{% /alert %}}

1. In the [Developer Portal](http://sprintr.home.mendix.com), go to **Apps** and select the app that has been detached from the source node.

2. Once you are in the app, go to the **Environments** tab in the left menu.

3. Click **select a node**.

4. Select the target node by clicking **Use this Node** and link it to your app. The currently linked (temporary) app will be unlinked automatically. The temporary app can be deleted.

For more information, see [Licensing Mendix Cloud Apps](/developerportal/deploy/licensing-apps/).

### 3.6 Changing the App URL

To change the App URL (if you are not using a custom domain) you will need to contact [Mendix Support](https://support.mendix.com). You will need to provide the following information:

* **URL** for the new app, which is available from the *Environments* page for the new app
* **URL** for the old app, which is available from the *Environments* page for the old app
* **App ID** for the new app, which is available from the *General* page for the new app
* **App ID** for the old app, which is available from the *General* page for the old app

### 3.7 Changing a Custom Domain{#custom-domain}

If you have a custom domain which you want to transfer to your target deployment, you will need to bear the following information in mind.

* The CNAME configuration in the DNS provider needs to have the following format: `{customdomain}.cname.mendix.net`
* If you own the private key for your existing custom domain name, you can reuse it for your target deployment
    * For a TLS certificate you uploaded yourself, you will have the private key
    * If you made a certificate request to Mendix, the private key will be stored in the Mendix Secure Keystore and you will need to ask Mendix Support to arrange for the certificate to be migrated to the target node

        The two certificate request options are shown below:
        {{< figure src="/attachments/developerportal/deploy/mendix-cloud-deploy/mxcloudv4/migrating-to-v4/tls-certificates.png" >}}

* When you start the app on the target node, it can take some time for the DNS servers on the web to register the new target URL and redirect your custom domain name to it â€” therefore you must set the TTL value to 300 seconds to speed up this process, if your TTL setting has a longer duration. This should be done some days in advance to ensure the setting is propagated to all DNS servers.

    For example, if you have a TTL of 24 hours, it will take 24 hours before the new domain will be active in the DNS. Customers who visit the custom domain through the browser will not end up at the target Mendix Cloud environment until 24 hours have passed. You should therefore check the TTL value a week or so before migration and change it to around 300 seconds (this is the default value we recommend).

You can find further information about setting up custom domains in [Custom Domains](/developerportal/deploy/custom-domains/).

### 3.8 Offboarding the Source Node

If everything works correctly after the migration, submit a request to [Mendix Support](https://support.mendix.com) to offboard the old node. This means that your previous node will no longer be available.

{{% alert color="warning" %}}
After your node is offboarded, it will no longer be accessible. Ensure that you have downloaded any backups or other information that you need from the node before asking for it to be offboarded.
