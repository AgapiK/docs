If this is the first time that you select apps on the **App Selection** page, you are then prompted to select if you allow the app to send you notifications. We do recommend you select **Allow** since sending notifications is one of the main features of this app.

The **My Apps** page by default shows the first app that you selected from the [App Selection](#app-selection) page. The name of this app is shown on top of the screen. If you click the app name, then you get the option to open a different app that you selected, or go back to the **App Selection** page where you can change the selection of the apps.
