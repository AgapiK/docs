## 1 What Is the Developer Portal?

The [Developer Portal](http://sprintr.home.mendix.com) is one of the key components of the Mendix Platform. In the Developer Portal, Mendix developers can collaborate, deploy, and manage their apps, and manage their company and users. 

The Developer Portal also offers open, well-defined APIs, enabling third-party developers to integrate their own widgets and plugins. For more information, see [API Documentation](/apidocs-mxsdk/apidocs/).

## 2 Company Buzz and Apps {#my-company-apps}

* Click **Company Buzz** to communicate with colleagues, team members, stakeholders, and any other Mendix users in your company
    * For more details, see the [Company Buzz](/developerportal/general/buzz/#company-buzz) section of *Buzz*
* Click **Company Apps** to see all the apps created by members of your [company](/control-center/#company)
    * If you click an app for which you are a team member, you will be taken to the app [Buzz](/developerportal/general/buzz/#app-buzz)
    * If you click an app for which you are not an team member, you will see the app details
    * You can also sort the order of the apps here

## 3 My Apps {#my-apps}

The **All** tab displays all the apps for which you are a [Team](/developerportal/general/team/) member. Any apps you pin with the pin icon will appear in the **Pinned** tab. Use the drop-down menu on the right side of the page to sort the apps by **Most Recent** or in alphabetical order of **App Name**.

The **Pending Invites** tab presents the pending invitations to apps that you have received (which you can **Accept** or **Decline**) in addition to the invitations you have sent. 

### 3.1 App Tiles

Click an app tile to see the app [Buzz](/developerportal/general/buzz/#app-buzz).

By clicking the ellipsis (**â€¦**) in the app tile, you can quickly perform a number of actions:

{{< figure src="/attachments/developerportal/quick-action-menu.png" alt="Quick actions menu for an app" width="50%" >}}

The actions available depend on the app selected. The default actions available are **Edit in Mendix Studio Pro** and **Leave App**.

To stop watching an app and disable notifications for that app, click the eye icon so that you see the tooltip **You are not watching this app**. To return to watching that app, click the eye icon so that you see the tooltip **You are watching this app**.

To go to the [licensed environments](/developerportal/deploy/environments/) of your deployed app, click **Environments** at the bottom of the app tile.

## 4 Navigation Pane {#navigation-pane}

When you select an app in the Developer Portal, you can navigate between sections using the navigation pane on the left side of the screen. The navigation pane is divided into four categories: [General](/developerportal/general/), [Project Management](/developerportal/project-management/), [App Insights](/developerportal/app-insights/), and [Deployment](/developerportal/deploy/general/).
