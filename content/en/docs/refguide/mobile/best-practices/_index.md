### Best Practices for Offline-First Apps
* [Deleted Flag](/refguide/mobile/best-practices/deleted-flag) – remove deleted objects from the offline database via Sync-to-device.
* [Incremental Synchronization](/refguide/mobile/best-practices/incremental-synchronization) – incrementally sync objects from the server to the device based on changed dates.
* [Batch Synchronization](/refguide/mobile/best-practices/batch-synchronization) – spread long synchronizations to multiple actions and present a progress to your users.
* [Compound Object](/refguide/mobile/best-practices/compound-object) – combine multiple objects to improve synchronization performance.
* [Request Object](/refguide/mobile/best-practices/request-object) – capture changes as objects and apply them after synchronization making these changes more secure.
