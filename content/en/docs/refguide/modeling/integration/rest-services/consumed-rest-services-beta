## 1 Introduction

Use the new Consumed REST service to send REST requests from Studio Pro. With this feature, you can build, test, and create data structures to store your requests. 

This feature is supported for [Studio Pro 10.6](add link) and above.

### 1.1 Use Cases

You can use this Consumed REST service to do the following:

* Consume a REST service
* Configure GET and POST requests
* Create entities directly in the domain model
* Send REST requests through a microflow

### 1.2 Limitations

*This feature supports the following HTTP request methods:
 *GET
 *POST
* To use the request response to create a data structure in your domain model, the response data should be in JSON format. Other formats, such as XML, are currently not supported. 
* If you are debugging a running Published REST service in the same app as your Consumed REST service document, a timeout issue will occur when sending the request.

### 1.3 Prerequisites 

*[Studio Pro 10.6](add link) and above
* Familiarity with [HTTP request methods]( https://www.w3schools.com/tags/ref_httpmethods.asp)
