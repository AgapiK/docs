## 1 Introduction

A **Retrieve workflows** activity can be used to retrieve a list of **System.Workflow** objects.

It needs the [Workflow Context](/refguide/workflow-parameters/) object as its input. A given Workflow Context object can be used to instantiate one or several workflow instances. It will break at Runtime if the passed Workflow Context object is empty.
