## 1 Introduction

Currently, some of Mendix's pluggable widgets are not fully compliant with strict Content Security Policy. Some of the widgets need access to 3rd party domain. By using allowing these domains, widgets can still follow allowlist CSP.

## 2 Setup

Please refer to [content security policy](/howto/security/csp/) document for setting up your application's CSP.
