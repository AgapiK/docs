## 1 Introduction

Connect to Microsoft SQL, MySQL, PostgresSQL, and Oracle databases with the [Mendix 10 Database](https://marketplace.mendix.com/link/component/2888) connector.

This connector is supported for Studio Pro [10.2](/releasenotes/studio-pro/10.2/) and above. 

### 1.1 Typical Use Cases

Use this module if you need to connect to databases and select data to use in your app. This connector allows you to directly test connections and queries during configuration in Studio Pro (design time). 

If you need to connect to other database types or use other statements besides `SELECT`, check out the [Database](/appstore/connectors/database-connector/) connector.

### 1.2 Features {#features}

This connector supports connections to the following database types:

* Microsoft SQL
* MySQL
* PostgresSQL
* Oracle

If you are looking for another database type, follow the prompt to request support your database when you open the the []

This connector supports the following statements:

* `SELECT` â€” retrieves rows and columns from a database

### 1.3 Limitations

This connector currently has the following limitations:

* MSSQL database connections is only supported on x64 architecture.

### 1.4 Prerequisites

* Studio Pro [10.2](/releasenotes/studio-pro/10.0/) or above
* External database connection details, including the following:
    * Login credentials
    * Database type
    * Hostname, port, and database name; or, instead, the JDBC connection string
* Familiarity with the [SELECT SQL query](https://www.w3schools.com/sql/sql_select.asp)

### 1.5  Dependencies

This connector has no dependencies.

## 2 Installation {#installation}

Download the [Mendix 10 Database Connector](https://marketplace.mendix.com/link/component/2888) and [add it to your app](/appstore/general/app-store-content/#install).

## 3 Configuration in Design Time {#configuration}

With this connector, you can test database connections and add queries and parameters during design time--before your app is running. This allows you to make sure everything works before deploying your app.

### 3.1 Getting Started: Connecting to a Database {#connect-database}

After [installing](#installation) the connector, get started by doing the following:

1.  Right-click on the module where you would like to add the connection and click **Add other > External database connection**. This opens the **Connect to Database** wizard:

    {{< figure src="/attachments/appstore/connectors/database-connector-mx10/database-wizard-filled-in.png" >}}

2.  Enter the information for the database to which you would like to connect. For detaild descriptions of the fields in the wizard, see the [Connect to Database Wizard](/refguide/external-database-connection/#wizard) section of the *External Database Connection* document entry in the Studio Pro guide.

3.  Click **Test Connection** to see if the connection works. If you do not see a green **Connection Succcessful** text pop-up, try checking your database details again.

4.  Click **Save** to open the external database document for this database.

Now you can start [querying the database](#query-database) to select data for use in your app.

### 3.2 Querying a Database {#query-database}

To query the database, do the following:

1. Enter a **Query Name** so you can access the same query later. This will be saved once you click **Save Query & Create Entity** in the [Create an Entity from the Response](#create-entity) section.
2. Enter your `SELECT`  **SQL Query** to select data from your database for use in your app. For example, the query `SELECT * FROM Cars` selects all rows in the **Cars** table:

    {{< figure src="/attachments/appstore/connectors/database-connector-mx10/select-query-columns.png" >}}
3. Click **Execute Query** to move to the **Response** screen and view the queried data.

#### 3.2.1 Adding Parameters {#parameters}

Click **Add Parameter** to add parameters to your SQL queries to pass dynamic values to the query at runtime. 

The example database in [Querying a Database](#query-database) is a table of cars with information like ID number, plate number, and model. Let's say you want to specify a certain car model while your app is running. You can add the following parameter:

{{< figure src="/attachments/appstore/connectors/database-connector-mx10/sample-parameter.png" >}}

And then use the parameter in the query, like this:

`select * from cars where model like {paramModelName}`

To learn more about SQL queries and parameters, consult the documentation of the database you are using, or read [How and Why to Use Parameterized Queries](https://techcommunity.microsoft.com/t5/sql-server-blog/how-and-why-to-use-parameterized-queries/ba-p/383483).

### 3.3 Using Query Response {#use-query-response}

After [querying the database](#query-database), you can look at the response in the **Reponse** screen. 

Click **Use Response** if you like what you see and want to move on to [creating an entity from the reponse](#create-entity).

{{< figure src="/attachments/appstore/connectors/database-connector-mx10/execute-query.png" >}}

### 3.4 Creating an Entity from the Response {#create-entity}

In the **Data Structure** screen you will see a preview of the queried data in an entity. You can adjust the entity name, though one is suggested for you:

{{< figure src="/attachments/appstore/connectors/database-connector-mx10/use-response.png" >}}

Click **Save Query & Create Entity** to create the entity and add it to your domain model:

{{< figure src="/attachments/appstore/connectors/database-connector-mx10/entity-created-from-database.png" >}}

### 3.5 Using the Entity in a Microflow {#entity-microflow}

Use the [Query External Database](/refguide/query-external-database/) activity to call the database in a microflow. Do the following:

1. Create a new microflow and drag the **Query External Database** activity into it.
2. In the **Database** field, click **Select** to choose the database you want to query.
3. Select the **Query** that you want to include in the activity (that you saved while [querying the database](#query-database)).
4. Include any [parameters](#parameters).
5. Specify whether you want **Return value** (for example, a list of `cars`).
6. Click **OK**.
7. Configure the end event (such as displaying a list, if you are selecting data to appear in a list). 

You can now use the microflow in your app. Here is an example of a configured microflow:

{{< figure src="/attachments/appstore/connectors/database-connector-mx10/example-microflow.png" >}}

See the [Query External Database](/refguide/query-external-database/) entry in the Studio Pro guide for further explanation of the properties in this activity.
