## 1 Introduction

The **Apps** page shows you all the apps belonging to your company and allows you to manage default app roles in your company.

## 2 Active and Deactivated Apps {#active-deactivated}

### 2.1 Overview {#overview}

On the **Active Apps** tab and the **Deactivated Apps** tab, you can see an overview of the active and deactivated apps that belong to your company.

When you select one or more apps via the checkboxes in the list, a context menu appears at the bottom of the screen with options for exporting app details to an *.xlsx* file, deactivating apps (on the **Active Apps** tab) or activating apps (on the **Deactivated Apps** tab), and deleting an app.

Deleting and deactivating apps is currently not supported for licensed apps or apps that are not running on Mendix Cloud.

{{% alert color="info" %}}
In the overview, you can activate or deactivate up to 100 apps at a time and delete 1 app at a time.

The consequences of deactivating and deleting an app are as below:

### 2.2 App Details {#app-details}

If you click the name of an app in the overview list, a page opens and shows the details of this app.

If the app is not a licensed app, you can see the **...** icon on the upper-right corner of the page. If the app is active, then you have the options to deactivate the app and delete the app; and if the app is deactivated, then you have the options to activate the app and delete the app.

{{% alert color="info" %}}
Deleting and deactivating apps is currently not supported for licensed apps or apps that are not running on Mendix Cloud. For the consequences of these operations, see the table in the [Overview of Apps](#overview) section.
{{% /alert %}} 

The app details page has the following tabs:

* **App Info** – This tab has the **Description** and **App ID** fields, which are also available on the [General Settings](/developerportal/collaborate/general-settings/) page for your app in the Developer Portal.
* **Members** – This tab presents the internal members and external members of the app.
    * You can directly deactivate an internal member from the app by clicking their name and selecting **Deactivate Member**.
    * For other member management options, click **Manage Members**, which will open the **Security** > [Team](/developerportal/general/team/#managing) page. As a Mendix Admin, you can also add yourself to a team via this page.
* **Environments** – This tab shows all Mendix Cloud environments. You can delete a free Mendix Cloud environment on this tab. Once the free environment is deleted, all data will be removed. However, the app team members can still access the associated app repository in the Developer Portal.
* **App Roles** – This tab presents the app team roles defined via the **Default App Roles** tab and/or customized for a particular app

## 3 Default App Roles

The **Default App Roles** tab shows the default [team roles](/developerportal/general/app-roles/#team-roles) assigned for every new app created in your company. Hovering over a role brings up options to **Delete** and **Edit** the role. Click **Add Role** to add a new default role, which includes permissions on accessing [Team Server](/developerportal/general/team-server/) and [Mendix Cloud](/developerportal/deploy/mendix-cloud-deploy/) information.
