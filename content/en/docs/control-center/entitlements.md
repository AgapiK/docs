### 1.1 What Are Cloud Credits? {#cloud-credits}

Cloud credits are virtual credits that you can spend on the Mendix Platform to purchase [Cloud Resource Packs](/developerportal/deploy/mendix-cloud-deploy/#resource-pack). Cloud credits provide a flexible and scalable way for your companies to mange costs and allocate resources.

If you want to top up the cloud credits or purchase (or change) cloud resource packs, contact your Customer Success Manager (CSM).
