## 10.7.0 {#1070}

### New Features
    
#### Conditional Editability on Data Views 

We introduced conditional editability for data views. This means that when all the input fields within a data view should be editable based on the same condition, you no longer need to repeat that condition for every input field. You can now specify that condition on data view level instead.

When conditional editability conditions are nested, e.g. an input field inside a conditional editable data view, or nested data views with conditional editability conditions, then the conditions are combined.

This is based on an [idea from Marco Bouwkamp](https://forum.mendix.com/link/space/app-development/ideas/1668) submitted to the Mendix Idea Forum. Thanks, Marco!

#### React Client

In our continuous effort to enhance makers experience, we are excited to introduce our new web client. This client is built entirely using React.js, a modern JavaScript library known for its efficiency and flexibility. The React client is available as a Public Beta and will be generally available in Mendix 10.12. For more information on what Beta release is, see [Beta and Preview releases](/releasenotes/beta-features/).

### Version Control: Alignign Merge Update Flow with Rebase

We aligned the merge flow with the rebase experience when you use update. Now both ways of updating are handled and managed by notification bars with similar controls.
For more information on these actions work and their differences, see [Combining Changes and Conflict Resolution](/refguide/merge-algorithm/).

#### Studio Pro on Mac (Beta)

Studio Pro on Mac is now in Public Beta. This allows you to run Studio Pro natively on Mac without having to use Parallels. With the Mac version of Studio Pro you can edit your apps the same way as on Windows using the functionality you are used to.

Known limitations:

* No native mobile support
* No support for document templates
* No **Structure mode** for the page editor 

### Improvements
    
- Logic Bot (beta) now supports parameter matching for Show Page activity.
- We have introduced the new selection property for the pluggable widgets API which allows widgets to read and set selections that can be used in actions, expressions or a `Listen to` data source of a data view.
- We have changed the keyboard support for MendixChat when it comes to building and sending a prompt. "Enter" sends while "Shift + Enter" adds a new line. "Ctrl + Enter" works in the same way as "Enter", because "Ctrl" is not taken into account anymore.
- When selecting a REST request for a REST request microflow call action, we now offer a "New" button to directly create a new REST request.
- Consumed REST Service now supports variables in request headers.
- We block Rebase feature in case installed git version is lower than 2.41
- When moving documents that have roles configured for them (pages, microflows, etc...) to a different module, we will now try and remap the configured roles to roles with the same name from the module that you are moving the documents to.
- We improved the scaling of the new access rule editor when expanding the view.
- We improved the scroll behaviour in the new access rule editor. Next to this we made various small improvements with regards to focus, selection and the ordering in the user interface.
- When a Data view listens to a pluggable widget while in Design Mode, now an overlay icon and proper selection highlighting will be shown on both widgets.
- We now support HTTP Method `PATCH` in consumed REST service (beta).
- We introduced an "application/json" as the default 'accept' header in Consumed REST service (beta). By having this 'accept' header, it helps the server know what response content type can be understood by the client application.
- Published OData services can now be hosted on any location path, not just `/odata`.
- The [list of published OData services](/refguide/published-odata-services/#61-general) on `/odata-doc` now shows the [service names](/refguide/published-odata-services/#21-service-name) rather than the locations of the services.
- We moved the *Send external object* and *Delete external object* activities to the *Integration activities* category in the microflow toolbox.
- We upgraded the Azure Blob Storage dependency from 8.6.6 to 12.25.1.
- We improved the error messages that are logged when the number of users exceeds the licensed amount.

### Fixes
    
- We made a fix to avoid case where Logic Bot (beta) had a performance issue with some blank apps.
- We made a fix to prevent where Logic Bot (beta) sends an invalid request to MARS.
- We fixed an issue where Logic Bot (beta) does not show newly created Microflows and Nanoflow in suggestions list
- We fixed an issue where, for the first time that the user opened MendixChat, they had to click on "Sign in" even though they were already signed in to Studio Pro
- We fixed an issue where the last row did not get imported from the Excel to the Batch Translate dialog. (tickets #199182, #202693)
- We fixed scenarios when values entered into the new expression editor were not saved (i.e. when generating an expression via the ‘Generate’ button in the ‘Edit Change Item’ dialog).

- We improved performance of dangling reference cleanup procedure on a first run of a new app
- Using an empty collection in the Java APIs `XPathQuery.setVariable` or `IParameterMap.putCollection` no longer results in invalid SQL being generated.
- We fixed a case in OQL where the ON condition of an INNER JOIN could be lost if only ID attributes of the entities were used. (Ticket 204833)
- We now validate the attribute names of business events on creation to not have the same name as an attribute from the generalization entities.

- We fixed an issue in the microflow editor where the output variable on a cast object action activity would not be set to the correct entity.

- Logic editors: We fixed an issue where the return type of a list operation showed "(Not set)" when using predefined variables.
- We fixed an System.ArgumentOutOfRangeException in Microflow Expressions using if-then-else expressions (fixes 204039).
- We fixed an issue where the 'Add' and 'Remove' options in the properties dialog of the 'Change Object' microflow activity were not active. (ticket #201629)

- We fixed an issue where an error would show when trying to modify entity members through the "Change object" microflow action.

- We fixed an issue where the user was unable to open a microflow that referenced a deleted query when using the external database connector package.
- We fixed a bug where after downloading a branch there is shown Ops dialog with Not a Mendix Git-url error.
- We fixed an issue when user tries to navigate to a deleted element through Find Results. A user is now notified that the target element had been deleted.
- We fixed an issue with the new access rule editor being out-of-sync when having unsaved changes to the entity.
- Fixed an issue with the new access rule editor not restricting editing based on the capabilities of the entity.
- Fixed an issue where a Select button on a datagrid would throw an error. (Ticket 203690)
- Fixed an issue where `mx.exe create-module-package` did not include widgets.
- We fixed an issue where changes couldn't be saved or cancelled when using an input reference set selector widget in a data view without an object. (Ticket 201170)

- We fixed an error when selecting an association for a pluggable widget, e.g. the Combo box widget, inside a snippet with multiple parameters. (Ticket 204133)

- We fixed an error in the client when a widget selection variable was used in an expression inside a list widget,
e.g. inside a List view or a Gallery widget. 

- We fixed an issue in which a microflow or a nanoflow is directly created with a default name without asking for it.

- We fixed an issue in which navigating back in history caused a Combo box widget using an association to break. (Tickets 205378, 205479)
- We fixed mxbuild throws an exception when there is a consistency error in the mapping document. (Ticket #203311)
- We fixed the schema import wizard for published web services in Studio Pro on MacOS
- We corrected the `@context` URL that is returned for OData actions that return an object or a list of objects. This now points to the entity type's metadata instead of that of the entity set.
- We fixed an error that would occur when consuming an OData contract that contains an action using an entity that is not exposed through an entity set. We now display these actions as having an unsupported parameter or return type.
- We fixed the OpenAPI 2.0 (swagger.json) contract for published REST services, where having a list parameter to an operation would result in an invalid swagger.json file (Ticket 203643).
- We fixed an issue with external entities where XPath constraints using the `contains` function with an empty search term would result in an error. (Ticket 204392)
- We fixed an issue in the Swagger UI interactive documentation pages for published REST and OData services. These pages do no longer allow configuration to be set via query parameters.
- We fixed an issue in the domain model editor where undoing changes to the domain model could cause an Oops dialog to pop up when making new changes.
- We have fixed an issue where breakpoints were not updating.
- We fixed an issue where you would get a NullPointerException due to specific Java dependencies at the startup of an app. (Ticket 203262)
- We reintroduced the fix for the issue where created files are not deleted when an error occurs in a microflow. (Ticket 199712)
- We reintroduced the improvement that updates the `changedBy` attribute when `storeFileDocumentContent` or `storeImageDocumentContent` from the Mendix Runtime API is used, or when uploading files. This makes it consistent with other ways of updating file documents or images.
- We improved handling of errors that can occur when committing `FileDocument`s.
- We corrected the result of the getMetaInfo method when called on a RetrieveIdListAction.
- We fixed a problem where using the setting "Public application root URL" without an explicitly specified protocol (e.g. "example.com" instead of "http://example.com/ ") was causing issues. (Ticket #197968)

### Deprecations   

- We have removed the legacy microflow editor.

### Known Issues

* Studio Pro might crash when using the new expression editor in combination with accessibility tools (for example, enabling the text cursor indicator).
    * Workaround: You can switch back to the old editor via **Preferences** > [New Features](/refguide/preferences-dialog/#new-features).
* The new expression editor does not work well with non-ASCII characters.
    * Workaround: You can switch back to the old editor via **Preferences** > [New Features](/refguide/preferences-dialog/#new-features).
* Line endings in CSS files are not being handled properly, so when using [Revert All Changes](/refguide/using-version-control-in-studio-pro/) or performing other version-control operations, CSS files appear in the [Changes on Disk](/refguide/version-control-menu/#show-changes) dialog box.
    * Workaround: For details, see [this section](/refguide/troubleshoot-version-control-issues/#css-error) in *Troubleshooting Version Control*.
* The first time you open MendixChat, you need to click **Sign in** so that it is available for use. This only needs to be done once after installing this version of Studio Pro.
* A finished parallel split path that is removed from a running workflow instance wrongly leads to a versioning conflict. Please note that "path" was called "branch" in earlier versions.
