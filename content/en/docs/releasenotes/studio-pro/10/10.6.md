### New Features

#### Add Landscape Rendering to Workflow Editor

- We added a feature that allows switching between portrait and landscape rendering of the workflow editor.

#### Consumed REST Service (Beta)

We are releasing the beta of version of the Consumed REST service. 
This new feature allows developers to integrate with REST services faster. 
You can now build your REST requests, test them directly, and convert their response to entities without building any of the mappings manually. 
For more information, see [Consumed REST Service (Beta)](https://docs.mendix.com/refguide/consumed-rest-services-beta/).

#### Rich Design Properties

- With this release we have improved the way in which design properties are displayed, configured and saved within studio pro. This allows users a better visual experience when interacting with the styling of their applications as well as more options with what they can configure using styling. In the past users were limited to using either a toggle button for simple on-off styling or a dropdown for selecting an option from multiple styles, and this change introduces the following new ways to interact with the styling:
  - Changing the technology behind our styling tab in the properties pane, allows for much more responsive behaviour when changing a widget's styling.
  - A color picker that extends the functionality provided by a dropdown by letting a user assign preview colors to each of the options.
  - A toggle button group with the option of multi selection that let's a user combine multiple toggles into a single control or display small lists from a dropdown in a friendlier way.
  - The toggle button group also integrates with icon collections to allow users to add icons to each option instead of displaying text.
  - A spacing control that gives a much better visual representation of how changes to margin and padding will influence a widget.
  - Complete integration into design mode show any changes made to the styling to be immediately within design mode.
  - Adding support for CSS variables when using a toggle button group, spacing control, dropdown or color picker, so that the user now has the option to define a CSS variable that allows for more lightweight scss files.
- To get access to these changes you can update Atlas Core from the Marketplace, where we have included the new design properties.
- Follow these 2 links to find out more about [extending design properties](https://docs.mendix.com/howto/front-end/extend-design-properties/) and [the design properties API](https://docs.mendix.com/apidocs-mxsdk/apidocs/design-properties/).

#### New Access Rule Editor

We are releasing the beta version of our redesigned access rule editor. In this new UI you can easily view and edit the access rules of an entity in one single overview. Enable the new UI in the [Preferences Dialog](https://docs.mendix.com/refguide/preferences-dialog/#new-features) inside Studio Pro.

### Version Control: Pre-Check of the Size of Files Being Committed

We have introduced a new step during commit process that checks for large files that are being added or changed. 
We want users to be informed about them as large files can become problematic for git.
- You can now select which widgets to include when exporting a module. This is useful in case you want to create marketplace modules that depend on other modules, and you do not want to include their widgets in your module.
- We added the wait for timer event for workflows that, when added to a workflow, will stop the process execution until the defined period of time has elapsed.

- We added a new Retrieve Workflow Activity Records microflow activity, which allows you to retrieve a list of `System.WorkflowActivityRecord` objects for a given worfklow instance. Each `System.WorkflowActivityRecord` represents a snapshot of a workflow activity.
- It is now possible to use the selection of a pluggable widget as a variable in an expression. This allows you to write expressions like `$dataGrid2_1 != empty` or `length($dataGrid2_2) > 1`. You can also use an attribute (path) from a selection variable (e.g. `$dataGrid2_1/Name`), as long as the expression is not used for conditional visibility, conditional editability or validation.
- External entities can now have attributes that are based on a property of a complex type, as long as it is a single-valued complex type that has supported properties. This is achieved by flattening the properties of the complex type to properties of the entity.

### Version Control: Storage Space Optimization

We have introduced an optimising storage solution triggered when heuristics indicates at least five megabytes can be saved on .mpr size.

### Version Control: Combining Changes with Rebase

We have introduced 'Rebase' as the default action for combining local changes with changes on the server, as an alternative to making a 'Merge commit'. Using Rebase results in a simpler commit history, as all commits are made sequential.

You can choose how to combine your work with the server state every time you interact with the server. Whether you're attempting to make a commit, pull or push, Studio Pro will detect if you're behind on the server and let you choose how to proceed. We recommend you to use Rebase in most scenarios, but you can adjust the default with a user preference if needed.
For more information on how these actions work and their differences, please check out the [documentation](https://docs.mendix.com/refguide/merge-algorithm/).

#### Other New Features

- We are adding MendixChat, our AI-powered knowledge assistant for Studio Pro
- MendixChat is released as Beta and can be accessed through the View -> MendixChat menu in Studio Pro
- We've implemented a new text editor that works on both Windows and MacOS (cross platform). 
It's set to be enabled by default. We have added a switch to the ‘New features’ in the ‘Preferences’
dialog where it is possible to go back to the legacy text editor.
- We now use database foreign key constraints validation for new projects

- We have added the ability to change the search and sort-by options for List View widgets from the properties.
- We have added the ability to change the sort-by options for Data Grid, Reference Set Selector, and Template Grid from the properties.

### Improvements

#### Mac Support for Mapping Editor (Beta)

- We have updated mapping editor to accommodate future improvements and making it Mac compatible.

#### Other Improvements

- We're using the term path now in the runtime as well (instead of branch) for parallel splits in workflows.
- We've removed the path number in jump-to details for the end of path/branch.
- When importing modules, we now ignore included widget packages if their version is older or the same version as an already installed widget package.
- We have changed the system with which the Client API documentation is generated. This comes with a new more modern look that will make it easier to find your way around in the API documentation.
- Logic Bot [beta]: When the user is not logged in or offline, the AI generated suggestions are not available. The user is now notified through the logic bot menu.
- Logic Bot (beta) now shows parameterized recommendations for Change List.
- The dataview now has a "main" and "footer" node within the page explorer to reflect what is on the canvas.
- We changed the sorting mechanism in Go To dialog. The excluded items now appear at the end of the list of avaiable entries. This is based on an idea from Luuk de Bakker. Thank you Luuk. (Idea forum link: https://forum.mendix.com/link/space/studio-pro/ideas/3987)
- Logic Editors (beta) We added control points for bezier curves
- Logic Bot (beta) now shows Retrieve list before Retrieve first for a parameterized suggestion.
- Logic Bot [beta] menu content generation has been optimized and can now show more items.
- When a Data view listens to a pluggable widget, now an overlay icon and proper selection highlighting will be shown on both widgets.
- We added an App Settings > [Miscellaneous](https://docs.mendix.com/refguide9/app-settings/#miscellaneous) option *Use Data grid 2, Combo box and Image widgets for content generation*, enabled by default. If these modern widgets are available in the app, they will be used when generating overview pages or generating the content of data views.
- We made a few improvements on the Data Grid 2 configuration when automatically generating the columns when an entity for the data source is selected.
- We changed the dialog to change an entity published in an OData service. The fields about the structure and the fields about the data are now in two separate group boxes.
- We improved the $metadata for published OData services. It no longer has the Com.Mendix.IsAttribute annotation defined when that annotation is not used.
- We have upgraded UI library used in Studio Pro to the latest version.

### Fixes

- We resolved a crash that could occur when refreshing the App Explorer contents.
- We fixed an issue where Studio Pro did not properly check if an attribute coming from an external entity was filterable and/or sortable, causing an exception in the runtime when trying to retrieve the data in the client.
- We fixed an issue in the Microflow editor where adding an object to a Microflow through the context menu would not automatically select the created object.
- Logic Editors [Beta] We fixed the error handler connection points on activities that have custom error handlers.
- Logic Editors (beta) We fixed showing logic bot suggestion flow with the error handler.
- Logic editors (beta): We fixed an issue with MxAssist not opening on a newly created Microflow, Nanoflow or Rule.
- We fixed an issue where scheduled task is executed before the calling microflow finishes successfully. (Ticket 202006)
- We fixed an issue where changing the microflow of a scheduled event does not have any effect. (Ticket 190445)
- We simplified the handling of errors in log subscriber message processing. These errors are now always printed on the standard error output instead. For the file log subscriber this means that repeated errors are no longer written to .err files. (Tickets 196306, 200771)
- We fixed a an issue where created files are not deleted when an error occurs in a microflow. (Ticket 199712)
- The `changedBy` attribute is now updated when `storeFileDocumentContent` or `storeImageDocumentContent` from the public API is used, or when uploading files. This makes it consistent with other ways of updating file documents or images.
- We fixed error **"LibGit2Sharp.NotFoundException: No valid git object identified by 'some_branch' exists in the repository."** while local cloning.
- We mitigated CVE-2023-29331 by updating third-party dependencies. This CVE does not pose any apparent risk for Mendix customers.
- We fixed the issue when ALT-F7 shortcut would trigger tab switcher instead of performing a debugger action. (Ticket 201938)
- We fixed a bug where login page settings would throw a consistency error about a non-existent page, even though anonymous users were disabled. They are now cleared when anonymous users get disabled.
- We have made changes to better provide error and label consistency in Microflow (Workflow)actions form when a variable is deleted, if it was being used.
- We fixed a bug where the data source of widgets was missing as a parameter when creating a new microflow or nanoflow for the [call microflow](https://docs.mendix.com/refguide/on-click-event/#call-microflow) or [call nanoflow](https://docs.mendix.com/refguide/on-click-event/#call-microflow) client action.
- We fixed an issue with published microflows in OData services where errors with access rights would result in a generic 500 Internal Server Error. The services now return a clear error description.
- We fixed an issue in published web services in Studio Pro where creating a mapping for custom authentication would result in an error.
- We fixed an issue with published OData services where filtering on properties of an associated object could return an error. (Ticket 200775)
- We now prevent using `file` as a URL prefix, as well as any known static folder in the deployment directory.
- We no longer log a warning when exporting to Excel from a data grid. (Ticket 172006)
- We've fixed a memory leak that would occur when opening pages. This would cause issues after opening thousands of pages. (Ticket 197048)

### Deprecations

- We've deprecated the END_OF_PARALLEL_SPLIT_BRANCH enum constant in the WorkflowActivityType (Java API).
- We removed the deprecated "Import web service/XML file" button from the domain model toolbar.
[**VERIFY**] - Import Web Service or XML Schema wizard will be removed in 10.6

### Known Issues

* [**VERIFY FOR FIX**] A finished parallel split branch that is removed from a running workflow instance wrongly leads to a versioning conflict.
