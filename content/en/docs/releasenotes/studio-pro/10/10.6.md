### New Features

#### Landscape Rendering for Workflow Editor

* We added a feature that allows for switching between portrait and landscape rendering of the workflow editor. [**TW**]

#### Consumed REST Service (Beta)

We are releasing the beta version of the consumed REST service, which allows you to integrate with REST services faster. You can now build your REST requests, test them directly, and convert their response to entities without building any of the mappings manually. For more information, see [Consumed REST Service (Beta)](/refguide/consumed-rest-services-beta/). [**VERIFY LINK**]

#### Rich Design Properties

With this release, we have improved how design properties are displayed, configured, and saved. This provides a better visual experience when interacting with your app styling in addition to more options for styling configuration. In the past, you were limited to using either a toggle button for simple on-off styling or a drop-down menu for selecting an option from multiple styles. 

This release introduces the following new ways to interact with styling: [**TW**]

* We changed the technology behind the **Styling** tab in the **Properties** pane, enabling more responsive behavior when you are changing a widget's styling.
* There is a color picker that extends the functionality provided by a drop-down menu by letting you assign preview colors to each option.
* There is a toggle button group with the option of multi-selection that lets you combine multiple toggles into a single control or display small lists from a drop-down menu in a friendlier way.
    * The toggle button group also integrates with icon collections to enable adding icons to the options instead of displaying text.
* There is a spacing control that gives a much better visual representation of how changes to margins and padding will influence a widget.
* There is now complete integration with **Design mode** for immediately displaying any changes made to the styling.
* We added support for CSS variables when using a toggle button group, spacing control, drop-down menu, or color picker. This means you can define a CSS variable that allows for more lightweight .*scss* files.

To access these changes, update the [Atlas Core](https://marketplace.mendix.com/link/component/117187) Marketplace module, where we have included the new design properties. [**TW: COMPONENT DOC**]

To learn more, see [How to Extend Design Properties](/howto/front-end/extend-design-properties/) and the [Design Properties API](/apidocs-mxsdk/apidocs/design-properties/).

#### New Access Rule Editor (Beta)

We are releasing the beta version of our redesigned [access rule](/refguide/access-rules/) editor. In this new UI, you can easily view and edit the access rules of an entity in one single overview.

Enable the new UI via the option in the [Preferences](/refguide/preferences-dialog/#new-features) dialog box. [**TW: BETA, DOCS**]

#### Version Control Updates

[**TW**]

We have introduced a new step during the commit process that checks for large files that are being added or changed. We want you to be informed about this, as large files can become problematic for Git.

We have also introduced an optimizing storage solution triggered when heuristics indicates at least five megabytes can be saved on the *.mpr* size.

#### Other New Features [**OR IMPROVEMENTS?**]

* We've implemented a new text editor that is enabled by default (with the option in **Preferences** > [New Features](/refguide/preferences-dialog/#new-features) to go back to the legacy text editor). This new text editor will also work on MacOS. [**TW**]
* We now use database foreign key constraint validation for new apps. [**IMPROVEMENT?**]
* We added the ability to change the search and sort-by options for a [list view](/refguide/list-view/) widget from its properties. [**TW**]
* We added the ability to change the sort-by options for data grids, reference set selectors, and template grids from their properties.
* You can now select which widgets to include when exporting a module. This is useful in case you want to create Marketplace modules that depend on other modules, and you do not want to include their widgets in your module.
* We added a **Wait for timer** event for workflows that stops the process execution until the defined period of time has elapsed. [**TW**]
* We added a new **Retrieve workflow activity records** microflow activity that enables retrieving a list of **System.WorkflowActivityRecord** objects for a given worfklow instance. Each System.WorkflowActivityRecord object represents a snapshot of a workflow activity.
* It is now possible to use the selection of a pluggable widget as a variable in an expression. This enables writing expressions like `$dataGrid2_1 != empty` or `length($dataGrid2_2) > 1`. You can also use an attribute (path) from a selection variable (for example, `$dataGrid2_1/Name`), as long as the expression is not used for conditional visibility, conditional editability, or validation.
* An external entity can now have an attribute based on a property of a complex type, as long as it is a single-valued complex type that has the supported properties. This is achieved by flattening the properties of the complex type to the properties of the entity.

### Improvements

* We changed the sorting mechanism in the [Go to](/refguide/go-to-option/) dialog box. The excluded items now appear at the end of the list of avaiable entries. 

    {{% alert color="info" %}}This is based on an [upvoted idea from Luuk de Bakker](https://forum.mendix.com/link/space/microflows/ideas/3987) submitted to the Mendix Idea Forum. Thanks, Luuk!{{% /alert %}}
    
* We updated the mapping editor to accommodate future improvements and make it Mac compatible.
* We are now using the term "path" now in Mendix Runtime (instead of "branch") for parallel splits in workflows. [**TW**]
* We removed the path number in jump-to details for the end of a path/branch.
* When importing modules, we now ignore included widget packages if their version is older than or the same version as an already installed widget package.
* We changed the system with which the [Client API](/apidocs-mxsdk/apidocs/client-api/) documentation is generated. This comes with a new more modern look that will make it easier to find your way around in the API documentation.
* In MxAssist Logic Bot (beta), when you are not logged in or you are offline, the AI-generated suggestions are now not available. You will be notified through the Logic Bot menu.
* MxAssist Logic Bot (beta) now shows parameterized recommendations for a Change list activity.
* MxAssist Logic Bot (beta) now shows **Retrieve** list before **Retrieve** first for a parameterized suggestion. [**TW: MAKES SENSE?**]
* The MxAssist Logic Bot (beta) menu content generation has been optimized and can now show more items.
* For the logic editors (beta), we added control points for bezier curves.
* The data view now has a main node and a footer node within the [Page Explorer](/refguide/page-explorer/) to reflect what is on the canvas.
* When a data view listens to a pluggable widget, an overlay icon and proper selection highlighting are now shown on both widgets.
* We added an option to **App Settings** > [Miscellaneous](/refguide/app-settings/#miscellaneous) for using the [Data Grid 2](/appstore/modules/data-grid-2/), [Combo Box](/appstore/widgets/combobox/), and [Image](/appstore/widgets/image/) widgets for content generation. This is enabled by default. If these modern widgets are available in the app, they will be used when generating overview pages or generating the content of data views. [**TW**]
* We made a few improvements to the Data Grid 2 configuration for automatically generating columns when an entity for the data source is selected.
* We changed the dialog box for changing an entity published in an OData service. The fields about the structure and the fields about the data are now in two separate group boxes. [**TW**]
* We improved the `$metadata` for published OData services. It no longer has the `Com.Mendix.IsAttribute` annotation defined when that annotation is not used.
* We upgraded the UI library used in Studio Pro to the latest version.

### Fixes

* We mitigated CVE-2023-29331 by updating third-party dependencies. This CVE does not pose any apparent risk for Mendix customers. [**VERIFY**]
* We no longer log a warning when exporting to Excel from a data grid. (Ticket 172006)
* We fixed an issue where changing the microflow of a scheduled event does not have any effect. (Ticket 190445)
* We simplified the handling of errors in log subscriber message processing. These errors are now always printed on the standard error output instead. For the file log subscriber this means that repeated errors are no longer written to .err files. (Tickets 196306, 200771)
* We've fixed a memory leak that would occur when opening pages. This would cause issues after opening thousands of pages. (Ticket 197048)
* We fixed a an issue where created files are not deleted when an error occurs in a microflow. (Ticket 199712)
* We fixed an issue with published OData services where filtering on properties of an associated object could return an error. (Ticket 200775)
* We fixed the issue when ALT-F7 shortcut would trigger tab switcher instead of performing a debugger action. (Ticket 201938)
* We fixed an issue where scheduled task is executed before the calling microflow finishes successfully. (Ticket 202006)
* We resolved a crash that could occur when refreshing the App Explorer contents.
* We fixed an issue where Studio Pro did not properly check if an attribute coming from an external entity was filterable and/or sortable, causing an exception in the runtime when trying to retrieve the data in the client.
* We fixed an issue in the Microflow editor where adding an object to a Microflow through the context menu would not automatically select the created object.
* Logic Editors [Beta] We fixed the error handler connection points on activities that have custom error handlers.
* Logic Editors (beta) We fixed showing logic bot suggestion flow with the error handler.
* Logic editors (beta): We fixed an issue with MxAssist not opening on a newly created Microflow, Nanoflow or Rule.
* The `changedBy` attribute is now updated when `storeFileDocumentContent` or `storeImageDocumentContent` from the public API is used, or when uploading files. This makes it consistent with other ways of updating file documents or images.
* We fixed the "LibGit2Sharp.NotFoundException: No valid git object identified by 'some_branch' exists in the repository" error that occurred while cloning locally.
* We fixed a bug where login page settings would throw a consistency error about a non-existent page, even though anonymous users were disabled. They are now cleared when anonymous users get disabled.
* We have made changes to better provide error and label consistency in Microflow (Workflow)actions form when a variable is deleted, if it was being used.
* We fixed a bug where the data source of widgets was missing as a parameter when creating a new microflow or nanoflow for the [call microflow](/on-click-event/#call-microflow) or [call nanoflow](/on-click-event/#call-microflow) client action.
* We fixed an issue with published microflows in OData services where errors with access rights would result in a generic 500 Internal Server Error. The services now return a clear error description.
* We fixed an issue in published web services in Studio Pro where creating a mapping for custom authentication would result in an error.
* We now prevent using `file` as a URL prefix, as well as any known static folder in the deployment directory.

### Deprecations

* We've deprecated the END_OF_PARALLEL_SPLIT_BRANCH enum constant in the WorkflowActivityType (Java API).
* We removed the deprecated "Import web service or XML file" button from the domain model toolbar.
[**VERIFY**] - Import Web Service or XML Schema wizard will be removed in 10.6

### Known Issues

* [**VERIFY FOR FIX**] A finished parallel split branch that is removed from a running workflow instance wrongly leads to a versioning conflict.
