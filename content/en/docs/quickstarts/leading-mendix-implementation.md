### Lecture 1.2 Who This Guide Is For, How to Use It, and for How Lon
This guide is tailored for organizations new to Mendix, especially for leaders responsible for implementing Mendix in their company. It is designed to help you navigate your Mendix journey from starting up until your first application is launched. It also reflects the most common steps in that journey and is a collection of resources you can use to ensure success on each of these steps.

We will not talk about technical setup here, but will guide you through managing the organizational change along with all the initial decisions you will need to make to ensure success. Think of this guide as your guide to getting started with Mendix at your company and if you are (a part of the team) in charge of making that a success, then this is the perfect starting point for you.

The content in this guide can be covered in a few hours, but it was designed as more of a guide versus a course, so you will likely come back to it as you are working towards getting that first app live. Our most successful customers tend to do that within 4-5 months, but the time frame heavily depends on your organization, the choice of that first app, and many other factors that will also influence how long you might find the content in this guide useful.

In this module you will learn about the 5 P’s of Digital Transformation and their importance to your Mendix success. You will also get an overview of the Mendix platform and learn where you can find all the extra information you may need. 

### Learning Objective
Let’s start with building the foundation of your Mendix knowledge!

By the end of this module, you will: 

* Assign your Mendix Admin 

* List the different components of the Mendix platform and explain their rol
* Identify the three major stages of the Digital Execution Practice and what each stage entail
* Describe the 5 P’s of the Digital Execution Practice and their importance to your long-term succes

## Lecture 2.1 Assign Your Mendix Admi
First let’s get one admin (no pun intended) thing out of the way. Youcompany needs **at least one Admin**. It might make sense for thfirst admin to be you and then you can easily assign as many otheadmins as you need.

So why do you need an admin? Your developers are able to create neapps, invite other users to their app teams, deploy apps, and invitapp end-users to give feedback, among many other activities. Insightinto these company activities are provided in [Control Center](https://controlcenter.mendix.com/index.html) in one central overview. You can read more about Control Center here](https://docs.mendix.com/control-center/) or follow thi[learning path](https://academy.mendix.com/link/paths/116/Govern-and-Scale-your-App-Landscape-with-Mendix-Control-Center).

Do you already have at least one admin? If that’s the case, you can see them on the list when you open [Control Center](https://controlcenter.mendix.com/index.html), and you can skip the rest of this lecture.

A **Mendix Admin** will normally be someone in the IT department of your company, and they will have full access to Control Center, which will give them visibility and essential controls to make sure the appdeliver business value at acceptable cost and risk. You can assign your first Mendix Admin through [Mendix Support](https://support.mendix.com/hc/en-us/requests/new), just choose "Standard Change: Assign Mendix Admin" from the dropdown. This first admin can then [add other admins](https://docs.mendix.com/control-center/company-settings/#3-mendix-admins). 

## Lecture 2.2 Get Familiar With Mendi
https://videoshare.mendix.com/watch/AVffVf7KCVt7h1ioBvUQ1
Let’s start with building the foundation of your Mendix knowledge anget you familiar with the Mendix platform!

Mendix is the platform that helps you turn ideas into outcomes. It contains all the tools you need to plan your application portfolio, ensure the right ideas get invested in, manage the entire applicatiodevelopment lifecycle, and get end-user feedback on what to build. ThMendix platform also provides a space for anyone working with Mendito interact with the community, share ideas and components as well afind help in case they get stuck.

## Lecture 2.3 Introduction to Digital Execution Practice (DEP): the 3 S’s and the 5 P’
**The 3 S’s of Digital Execution Practice: Start, Structure anScale**

Your journey to innovation will go through three major stages:
**Start**, **Structure** and **Scale**. You are now in the **Start**
stage, where the goal is to lay the foundations for your innovatiofactory. In Start, you want to develop applications that realize valuquickly. The reason for this is two-fold:

1.  You’ll be spending a lot of time building a team and putting the necessary prerequisites in place in terms of infrastructure and process. Because of that... 

1.  You want quick wins. Quick wins are important because you’ll use these to prove the value of your new approach. Celebrating youfirst success will help you gain broader support around the company.

If the Start stage is about establishing and proving the benefits orapid application development, then **Structure** is about buildinout predictability and continuity. Structure is about growing froyour first set of apps to a portfolio with a diverse array of appaddressing multiple use cases, expanding your first team into multiplteams, and expanding your developer center. 

Structure is about taking the process of your first agile experiencthat you established in Start to a process that institutes shorterelease cycles under strict governance. Structure is where you begito formalize your rapid application development process — establishinan architecture, enabling continuous delivery, and creatingovernance. By establishing predictability and stability, you’rbuilding the scaffolding for future successes.

In **Scale**, you have learned how to use Mendix to speed up and scalout app development and start delivering real value for your business.
Your talent has been trained and activated in such a way that you cashift them around the organization to work on projects where theiskills are best put to use. You are applying greater automation tyour processes to efficiently and rapidly deliver and manage hundredof applications with strategic impact. This includes automatindeployment and maintenance to support a large portfolio, automatinquality assurance to proactively monitor the maintainability of youprojects, and enabling greater reusability by establishing a privatapp store. With these capabilities in place, you maximize value anproductivity by creating distributed innovation capabilitiethroughout the enterprise. You have achieved continuous productivitand efficiency.

**The 5 P’s of Digital Transformation**

Sounds great, right? But how do you get there? Step by step. There arfive major areas you will need to focus on. We call these the **5 P’of Digital Transformation** and aligning the P’s (Portfolio, PeopleProcess, Platform, and Promotion) to your organization's digitastrategy is crucial to your Mendix success. Let’s go over them one bone.

<img src="./markdown/media/image4.png"
style="width:6.5in;height:3.53438in" /

## 2.3.1 Portfolio: Choosing a Use Case That Is Equally Meaningful and Doabl
Getting your digital transformation program off the ground starts witidentifying the right projects and creating an application portfoliof quick wins in high-value initiatives.

Why quick wins?

Proving the value of a program—whether it’s through software thaallows your business to create a new channel of revenue or aapplication that saves employees time on an internal process—allowyou to realize immediate success and justify a broader organizationachange. A diversity of use cases is important here, to show that youapplication portfolio can reach many different departments and addresa variety of needs.

And guess what? We have a tool to help you with that. Mendix PortfoliManagement gives you a way to identify, track, and plan out youinitiatives. So, let's get started by creating your Portfolio boar[here](https://portfolio.mendix.com/index.html). All you neeto do is click on *Get Started* and then *Create your firsPortfolio*. 

<img src="./markdown/media/image5.png"
style="width:6.5in;height:3.15859in" /

If you would like to learn more about how to manage your portfolio oideas and applications, . You might also have done a portfoliworkshop with Mendix experts before, in which case, you may alreadhave an Excel file with your list of initiatives that you can easilimport into your brand new board. If not, we discuss your first apselection in more detail in Module 3.

## 2.3.2 People: Building a Strong Mendix Tea
The people you choose for your teams are absolutely crucial to thsuccess of your digital execution program. You want to find the righpeople with the right skills who are excited about and can commit timand energy to the program, no matter their job title. 

 

A strong first Mendix team is more than just the number of people ithe room. Your first Mendix team should include a core developmenteam comprised of a combination of a professional developer — someonwith technical expertise — and a business developer — someone familiawith the platform that can act as a power user if needed. The key ito have developers who can collaborate closely with end usersbridging the gap between business needs and technical possibilities.
In the beginning, it’s highly likely that not all these people wilcome from your own organization (we will further review the options iLecture 3.7), but this is an overview of all the higher level roleyou will need sooner or later.

The following leadership roles are essential to the success of any neplatform or paradigm:

* **Executive Sponsors:** Success starts at the top, where senioexecutive buy-in is a must. These are the top-level executivesideally representing both the Business/Operations and IT, who arwilling to be engaged periodically to provide oversight ansteering-committee level guidance. These people won’t necessarily binvolved day-to-day, but they understand the big picture vision ohow Mendix will help the enterprise achieve its digitatransformation and low-code goals, how it fits to ‘play nicely’ witother technology stacks and tools like Microsoft’s ADO or PoweApps, and what the transformational value is expected. Your Menditeam can work with these individuals to help understand, define, anrefine their role, the value proposition for high ROI, etc.

<!-- --

* **Program Owner:**  You need a person to lead the program anmandate/enable change; who generates excitement about the importancof this transformation and can inspire people to *want* tparticipate. This person is directly responsible for the overalsuccess of the platform’s implementation, bringing impactful apps tfruition, ensuring value targets are defined and tracked, and thathe teams are properly assigned and allocated for success. 

It’s common for Program Owners to work very closely with their MendiCSMs to define and implement success plans and to evolve those planover time to ensure ever-increasing returns and solid value. Fosmaller organizations, this person may also be part of the Core Teamfor larger organizations, it’s common for this person to be a part othe Center of Excellence leadership team or to be a dedicated senioresource overseeing global success. Areas of responsibility includassurance of proper architectural and governance guidelines/adherencesuccessful regional and global rollouts, successful teagrowth/training/enablement plans, KPI definition and tracking, etc.  

* **Center of Excellence Lead (COE Lead):** Generally, largeorganizations implement a Mendix COE to help define and enforce googovernance, development, and enablement practices that can evolvwith the business and technological changes for overall platform anprogram success throughout the enterprise over time. The COE Leaensures the Mendix COE is properly staffed to support, oversee anenable development teams, and ensures the products produced are ohigh-quality following best practices for high re-usabilitymaintainability and return on investment. This person generally hasufficient senior-level technical and managerial skills to oversethe COE’s Enterprise and Solution Architects, DevOps technicaleads, trainers and mentors, and other experienced staff.

**Product owners** are key players to a successful program, becausthey’ll have in-depth knowledge of the business, the product, and itusers, and will have insight into the value that it will create. Ipossible, make sure that your first product owner comes from your oworganization and is familiar with the problem you are setting out tsolve with your first application. Product owner is not really leadership role, but the choice of a product owner is crucial for thsuccess of your first app, which is why we touch on it here. can POare also a part of the agile scrum team, so we will mention them agaiin section 4.2.

**Architects** will help establish a target architectureinfrastructure, and governance. 

Finally, an **application development manager** needs to spearhead thinitiative and drive the program and the cross-functional teams whwill deliver on those projects. 

**The blueprint to build your first Mendix team**

We’ve created the blueprint for building your first Mendix teamassessing that team, and showing how it can grow and collaborate witthe business and other departments within your organization. 

**Find problem solvers** 

Find team members who care about solving business problems rather thapeople who prefer to build solutions based on detailed requirements.
There will be many obstacles to overcome due to existing processes anthe culture of the business, so seek out people who have a “can-do”
attitude who can be change evangelists. 

Traditional developers (with experience in programming languages sucas C#, Python, Java, etc.) are usually very quick to grasp Mendix awell. Here you might want to look for people who are moroutcome-oriented and love adding new tools to their toolbox.

That said, don’t get too hung up on job roles — you also need peoplwho want to test their limit and have some technical proficiency, bualso understand business challenges. A host of individuals that we’vseen successfully make the transition come from business analysis, UXfront-end web design, and business intelligence backgrounds. 

In the end, selecting the right team and arming them for success ithe cornerstone of success, not just for your first project but foyour entire rapid application development program. 

**A who’s who** 

It’s important to keep your team small as you build your Mendix Centeof Excellence (your central repository of development expertisereusable components, and governance guidance that business teams caaccess as they build their specialized solutions). With a small teamyou can deliver new applications quickly, avoiding much of thmiscommunication and delays that often come with larger developmenteams. Smaller teams encourage productivity and creativity. Amazon CEJeff Bezos’ “two pizza rule” states that you should never have meeting where two pizzas couldn’t feed the entire group. The smallethe team, the more room for brainstorming and peer review. 

**Mendix developers come with all types of skill-sets** 

Developers come from all parts of the business, not just IT. From youhigh-code programmers, to your business-centric developers, to youtech-savvy business analysts, low-code platforms let you build teamof makers from all backgrounds. 

As the main action point here, start thinking about who you need tkick off building your first Mendix application and start talking tthem about it. Some names are probably coming to mind already and yowill get much more information on who you need exactly in **Lectur4.2 Identify Your First Mendix Project Team**.

## 2.3.3 Process: Building Repeatable Practices for Long-Term Outcome
Successful digital execution means changing the way you work anestablishing rapid application development processes. Agilmethodologies like Scrum are a good starting point, splitting the worinto sprints and basing them off user stories, but you also need tchange from a traditional way of development and operations into BizDevOps approach, which promotes close collaboration and shareknowledge between the business team, developers, and operational team.
It ditches the division between those departments to get rid ounnecessary knowledge silos that only disrupt the information flow.

**Minimum Viable Product**

One important concept to embrace for your process (if you haven’already) is the **Minimum Viable Product (MVP)**. MVP is a version oan application with just enough features to be usable by earlcustomers who can then provide feedback for future development. 

Minimum viable products are meant to be incomplete by nature, with thgoal of delivering value quickly, then figuring out next requirementand iterating on them based on the input from actual users. Thiensures that the application will provide the right user experiencand achieve the goals you set. It is easier said than done, thoughand the change in the way of working takes a bit of time to get useto. If you haven’t involved your end users into the process before, imay feel like an extra task that is slowing you down but trust thprocess — getting their input early on will save you many costlchanges down the road. And just because something is not a part of thMVP, does not mean it won’t be delivered just a couple of days oweeks later, since this way of working enables lighting fasiterations!

**Put a governance structure in place** 

A core element to success is repeating it. Repeated success leads tand informs your governance around rapid application development. Yoneed to define and implement processes and rules around applicatiodevelopment that help you coordinate and control your applicatioportfolio. 

Governance is creating a centralized hub where you establish bespractices around agile and scrum, UI/UX, and guidelines around builddeployment, and architecture as well as security/compliance. You’rassigning the people on your team responsibilities around these bespractices. 

## 2.3.4 Platform: Tying All These Pieces Together With a Pure Low-Code Platfor
As you hurtle towards digital execution, the Rapid ApplicatioDevelopment platform you choose shouldn’t just be about new technologtrends, like Artificial Intelligence, Big Data, or Blockchain, owhatever comes down the line. You need a platform that also helps yoimprove operational efficiency, reduce time-to-market, and fostecollaboration between Business and IT. Something that addresses thpresent and prepares you for the future. Seek out a platform thahelps you not only deliver faster, but more accurately, so that yocan produce robust applications in a matter of weeks.

Mendix is a platform specifically built to tie all these piecetogether and enable enterprises to get things done quickly as well aallow your teams and technology ecosystem to evolve and embrace thdifferent technologies that will come along.

**High-level positioning** 

High-level positioning is about knowing how and where Mendix fits iwith the rest of your IT ecosystem. Use the Start stage to experiencthe benefits of instant provisioning, not just of the applicatioenvironment, but all the software needed to support the entirlifecycle, from project management to repositories. Learning morabout how easy it should be to deploy and operate apps shows hodevelopers can do this themselves and helps your innovation factorachieve continuous productivity and efficiency. 

**Deployment strategy** 

The Start stage is an excellent time to start exploring your clouoptions, and use this knowledge as input for strategic choices in thfuture. You’re most likely going to deploy your application on thMendix Cloud because it’s the most optimized cloud to run Mendix-builapplications. Built on top of Cloud Foundry and AWS, the Mendix Clouis the deployment solution in which Mendix provides hostinenvironments for you. It’s available globally and comes standard witdeep insights, alerting capabilities, high availability options, anbackups. 

<img src="./markdown/media/image6.png"
style="width:6.5in;height:1.64544in" /

But as you expand your portfolio and move from Start to Structure, yowill need to consider other deployment options and moving to multi-cloud environment. Understanding the cloud environments to whicyou’ll deploy—for example, the security features and how they fit intyour existing security framework—will help inform how you move tStructure. 

**Data and integration strategy** 

Similar to your deployment strategy, you also want to begiconsidering what your data and integration strategy looks like witMendix as a part of your overall technology ecosystem. You need tconsider your architecture strategy, too. This is an opportunity fothat vanguard architect you elected to come in and understand whaarchitecture works best for your development program. 

## 2.3.5 Promotion: Showcasing Your Successes and How They Connect to Your Strateg
We’ve all heard the saying, “If a tree falls in the forest but no onis around to hear it, does it make any sound?” Similarly, if you arexcellent at the core components of digital transformation but don’communicate it to anyone, does it really have an impact? That is wherpromotion comes into play. Without promotion, success can gunnoticed, and the value of your efforts may not be recognized.
Promotion tends to be a challenge for many IT organizations, in parbecause IT teams do not often have professional marketers. Evewithout a marketing team behind you, here are five ways you can bettepromote the value of low-code within your organization. 

***Shaping and communicating your low-code vision:** *We’ll help yosolidify your low-code vision later in this guide, but oncyou have it, don’t let it live on a shelf or in the cloud — allow ito evolve with input from your organization. Communicate your visioin cross-functional meetings and ask for support in gettinorganizational leadership to embed the vision into their message awell. 

***Stakeholder management:*** Involve stakeholders early and often tbuild enthusiasm for digital transformation success. Start by bringincross-functional partners on board who you already have stronrelationships with, and work together to identify the problems yowant to solve. By building a plan together you can help ensure youinitiatives will get support. 

***Internal PR:*** Build a plan for how you will raise awareness aninvolvement in your low-code implementation and ensure your executivsponsor helps your PR efforts. You can leverage existing communicatiochannels such as company meetings, newsletters, or sharecollaboration sites to spread your message. Start by sharing your plaand vision, and then use these channels to celebrate success afteyour first go-live.  

***Community building:*** Digital transformation is all about bringintogether business and IT. Start with a portfolio workshop tbrainstorm ideas for your first application, and then identify teamwho will collaborate through implementation and launch. Identify core group of champions who can raise awareness on your behalf evewhen you aren’t in the room. 

***Celebrating success:*** We love a good reason to celebrate, anhope you’ll use milestones large and small to celebrate yousuccesses. Acknowledging your achievements, whether it’s getting thteam to complete Academy certifications, building the first reusablcomponent, finishing the first development sprint or launching youfirst application, celebrations are a powerful way to boost teamorale and drive future momentum.

<span class="mark"\[Resources for this lecture Vision PreparatioQuestions PDF\]</spa
We encourage you to take the time to develop a clear vision folow-code development in your organization. It is critical to thsuccess of your low-code change initiative because it takes thguesswork out of people trying to understand what you want to achieve.
Low-code shouldn't (and frankly, doesn't) operate in its own universeso the vision should be aligned and contribute to other visionsvalues, strategies, and initiatives that are already in motion in youorganization.

There is a wide variety of ideas and opinions regarding the lengthform, structure, and scope of a vision. And your vision should reflecyour company's culture. We have compiled **a set of guidelines anrecommendations to help you in defining your vision**. Some are widelrecognized as best practices, and others are based on our extensivexperience. Your Mendix Transformation Manager, Digital BusinesAdvisor, or Customer Success Manager will be able to support you ithis endeavor. And if you have defined your low code vision alreadynow is the perfect time to revisit it and make sure you are happy witit. 

1\. **Preparation**

This step requires some analysis and time investment. Referenccompany documents and talk to your team and other key stakeholders othe business and technology side.

It is key to ensuring alignment and contribution to other visionsvalues, strategies, and initiatives that are already in place in youorganization. We have included a list of useful questions to considein the supporting content for the preparation task (you can find thiin the resources, at the top of this page).

2\. **First iteration: Mind map / brainstorm**

Start exploring the areas that you want to transform. We recommenthinking along the lines of the 5 P’s – People, Process, PlatformPortfolio, Promotion – because these cover all the aspects you neewhen undergoing a transformation. This also ties well into other toolwe use such as the Maturity Assessment, which is also groupeaccording to the 5 P’s.

Imagine how you want those areas to look like in 3-4 years. Thatimeframe is the perfect balance between realistic and achievable anit gives you the chance to work on different aspects simultaneously.
More than that and it's too far in the future, too fuzzy, you can'know what the world will look like in 10 years. Too short and there'not enough time to do something impactful – it won't be inspirational.
Add key words to a mind map for each of the five areas.

3\. **Second iteration: Prioritize and add details**

Select the most important ideas and create full sentences as bullepoints, adding details so that anyone reading the sentence caunderstand what it means.

You can also start adding key results or placeholders for them, sucas, "Achieve an ROI of \[amount\] by \[date\]".

4\. **Third iteration: Evaluate and refine**

Review and refine your bullet points. You need to ensure that you caevaluate whether a particular point has been completed or achieved.
Finish adding relevant key results or placeholders. You may choose tleave the actual numbers in the key results blank and ask your teamor key people in your organization to set the ambition levelthemselves. This creates ownership and buy-in to your vision.

Once you have full sentences for all bullet points and the relevankey results, you need to review them all, asking "Is this ambitiouenough or is it too ambitious?"

The objectives need to be achievable, but it also shouldn't be toeasy. You need to find that balance. But don't overthink it – you wilprobably need to adjust some key results along the way, and that's OK.
More about that in the "Use your vision to steer your journey"
objective.

5\. **Socialize your vision and gather feedback**

Show your draft vision to key stakeholders and a selection oemployees to get their feedback. When others read your vision, theneed to experience a moment of awe and wonder. If their jaws don’drop a little bit, you need to think bigger. Small, safe, calculateplans don’t inspire – a vision needs a wow factor. And don't be puoff if there’s a small number – around 10%-15% or so – who don't likit.

What you don't want is indifference.

Check during this refining stage that people understand the vision –
and that it accurately represents what you want to achieve and whayour organization needs.

**6. Write your final version**

In this final stage, you need to consider what feedback is relevanand what you want to incorporate.

If you think it would be more efficient, you might want to get supporfrom a writer to polish some of those sentences so they pop off thpage and resonate with your team and stakeholders. However, balancthe effort you invest – done is better than perfect!

**Communicate your vision effectively **

Once you have your vision, you need to communicate it effectively tyour team. You need to make sure that everyone understands it so thathey are motivated to work towards it. 

People should understand the significance of what they are doing. Theshould feel connected to something larger than themselves. That givetheir work meaning and shows their value in the organization. Thasense of meaning and purpose is one of the most fulfilling outcomes oa vision.

You may choose to have town halls or an all-hands to present it iperson. Others have made videos that can be shown asynchronously, anthat people can come back to for reference and for onboarding. Onlrelying on the written word such as email is usually not dynamic oinspiring enough for this type of communication. Be brave to trsomething new, but choose a tone and method that feels authentic, too.

## Lecture 3.2 Build Your Getting Started Pla
As the primary person responsible for the implementation of Mendiwithin your organization, it’s critical to have a plan for gettinstarted. So far, we’ve introduced the 5 P’s, and now it’s time tthink about how each of these relates to your own organization’success. Having a plan for getting started helps to build alignmenand buy-in among your business and IT stakeholders. Your low-codvision, as discussed in the previous section, is critically importanto this plan.

First, work with stakeholders to align your start stage goals and kechallenges. These goals should be focused on what success looks likfor your team and how to measure it. Goals could be something like “Athe end of Q3, we will have at least two apps live” or “We want tgenerate X-amount of ROI with our first application”. The start stagis all about bringing together your first team, building, deployingand celebrating your first apps while defining a future portfolivision. Keep your start-stage goals related to these topics, bucustomize them based on what you want to achieve. You should consideyour low-code vision as the future state you are working toward, thebreak those into digestible goals for your getting started plan.

After you’ve established your goals, think about the challenges thamight get in your way and then build a mitigation plan to avoid those.
Is your team new to working in Agile? Adopting a new way of workinmight be one of your challenges, and the getting started plan wilneed to focus on how to bring your team up to speed. Think through anfactors that might hinder your progress and work with stakeholders ohow you’ll tackle them together.

Now that you have your goals and challenges identified, considemilestones for each of the 5 P’s as part of your getting started plan.
Here are some ideas:

* Portfoli
* First app identifie
* App value definition complete
* First app liv
* Portfolio define
* Peopl
* First team traine
* Training and enablement plan define
* Team growth strategy define
* Proces
* Governance strategy define
* Mendix support introduce
* Stage retrospective execute
* Platfor
* Deployment strategy define
* Data and integration strategy define
* Architecture strategy define
* Promotio
* Host a go-live celebration for first applicatio
* Gather relevant stakeholders to show progres
* Share the success at company meeting or in newsletter
The final step of your getting started plan involves capturing your 5
P milestones and building a timeline. Below are some examples that wuse frequently with Mendix customers that you can take and make youown: Add details, and overlay dates appropriate for your organizationetc. Work independently or work with your customer success manager tthink through what this might look like for you.

## Lecture 3.3 Start Your Mendix Portfoli
Now let’s focus on developing your portfolio. Portfolio Management ia top-down process led by a portfolio manager and decision-makers. Itmain purpose is to assess potential initiatives and ensure they aligwith business goals. Initiatives that don't meet the criteria arexcluded from consideration.

To make sure that the strategy is reflected in the initiatives, you neeto put into place a program to ensure vision alignment at every levelacross every department. At this level, program owners or managerempower collaboration across departments. This will ensure that eversolution will always meet the criteria and support the goals of thvision. It’s about trying to create software that delivers immediatvalue, which requires input from and collaboration with many peoplacross your organization.

Portfolio Management starts at the company level, where strategy idefined. The company strategy leads to a Portfolio Vision, which itranslated into a backlog and budget for all initiatives. 

<img src="./markdown/media/image9.png"
style="width:6.5in;height:3.45677in" /

To start, think about the big picture: What is your organizatiostriving to achieve? Jot down a few ideas that can help you get there.
These could include solutions to migrate from legacy apps, improvcustomer experience or increase efficiency. And Mendix has a tool thelp you do just that!

You should have already created your portfolio in lecture 2.5, if yohaven’t yet let’s start by creating your Portfolio board, you can dthat by going [here](https://portfolio.mendix.com/), clickinOpen Portfolio Management and then click **Create Portfolio.**You camake it restricted for the time being (that means you will have tapprove other people before they gain access to it).  

If you have done a portfolio workshop already and maybe have your lisof initiatives in an Excel file, you can easily import them. If notjust create a few cards that represent your ideas. Your Mendix teacan also help you with this, so please do not hesitate to reach out tthem to go over everything together.

Portfolio management is a key activity that ensures you are alwaycreating solutions that bring the most value to your organization (ansince we’re talking Mendix here, this is where you also decide iMendix is the right tool for each one of the ideas). This means thayou (maybe together with your stakeholders) need to go over your maiportfolio, keep initiatives up to date and adjust or reprioritize ineeded. You can learn a lot more about this process in the dedicateguide . For now, the most important thing is to list thinitiatives that are top of mind for you and use that input to choosthe ideal first app. 

So, let’s add your initiatives. Click the *Create Initiative* buttoon the top right and start jotting down your ideas.

## Lecture 3.4 Finalize First Application Selection 

It’s important that your first applications bring immediate value upolaunch, because rapid application development isn’t just aboudelivering rapidly, it’s about realizing value quicker than you havbefore. 

We recommend that you start with adding at least three applicationideas to your portfolio. While the first success is always importantto truly grasp the new rapid application development process and thMendix platform, developing multiple apps and demonstrating repeatesuccess is a best practice. 

As for your very first project, you want to pick a use case out oyour portfolio that is equal parts meaningful and doable. A greafirst project is something that impacts the enterprise positively bucan be completed by a relatively small team in a reasonabltimeframe. 

Here’s a **quick checklist of things to consider when choosing youfirst application**:

**Go live quickly:** One of the main goals of your first applicatiois to validate your ability to rapidly bring new ideas to market. It’important that you identify quick wins, so select applications thaare limited in scope and can stand alone in production. 

**Make them worthy:** The first application should also be highlvisible within the organization. It must have the right urgency anexecutive support, and also deliver tangible business value. Select aapp idea where you’re sure the results will get noticed and thsuccess will be shared by your stakeholders. 

**Involve business stakeholders:** Requirements are often unclear anneed to be refined through collaboration with, and feedback frombusiness stakeholders. The goal is to illustrate the higher level ocreativity and collaboration facilitated by this new rapid applicatiodevelopment approach.   The key to involving business stakeholderlies with the role of the product owner. The product owner knows whaneeds to be built. Application success is achieved when thdevelopment team and product owner work together with a passion fomaking applications that deliver value. 

**Limit dependencies:** External factors over which you have littleor no control can quickly diminish the productivity advantage offereby the Mendix platform. That’s like using a permanent marker on brand-new whiteboard. 

**Don’t get bogged down in requirements:** Digital innovation projectare often marked by unclear business requirements. Don’t worry; thiis a good thing, because it is better to define a high-level goal opurpose versus having detailed requirements. The more requirementyour first applications have upfront, the longer it’s going to take trelease. Make sure that you have at least two follow-up iterationplanned so that you can capture and refine requirements and builtrust with the business stakeholders. This shows them that even itheir requirements don’t make it into the initial MVP, they will comin the next versions. 

**Make failures into wins:** It’s ok to admit defeat. In this caseit’s actually beneficial. It may sound contradictory, but good firsapplications are often ones that your organization previously faileto deliver.



For instance, a Mendix customer initially failed to build aapplication that calculates prices because the algorithm was sspecific to the business, and the .NET developer couldn’t grasp althe nuances. Using Mendix, business stakeholders and IT developerwere able to take that failure and turn it into a win, collaboratmuch more closely, and successfully deliver a first version of thapplication in a few days. 

**Make them smart:** To ensure that apps deliver the best possiblexperience to the user, they should be intelligent, contextual anproactive — i.e., smart. Develop an app that uses AI to personalize user’s experience or uses geolocation to tell let you know thlocation for the cake you ordered for your big app launch party. 

**The complexity matrix:**

Using the complexity matrix is a great way to assess the righprojects for your Start stage portfolio. 

**Exposure** is the amount of usage or availability an applicatiohas. **Complexity** can be defined as how technically complex thapplication is; i.e., how many integrations does the applicatiorequire? You want to start on the left-hand side of the quadrantwhich represents your team learning and feeling comfortable with thnew way of working.

**Which type of projects is Mendix a good fit for? **

Another thing that might help is understanding which type of projectMendix is the best fit for (and which ones are not a great fit).
Here’s a little guide for that.

**Mendix fits a wide variety of software applications, but some reallstand out as a perfect fit: **

* Any software requirement where there is no off-the-shelf solutioavailable 

* Software projects when the requirements are not very clear yet anthe business also requires flexibility during the developmenprocess 

* Software projects where there is going to be a high degree obusiness involvement during the development process 

* Situations where the customer wants to build multiple applicationand they want to benefit from reusing components 

* Applications that require multichannel (desktop/mobile/tablet etc.) 

* Workflow applications 

* Customer-facing applications that need to be pixel perfect 

* Flexible applications: applications that start small but need to bable to scale up 

* Applications that require governance, since things like audit antraceability are built in the platform 

* Projects where resources are scarce, since Mendix is easy to leardevelopers can be trained internally and citizen developers can bused 

* Applications that the customer wants to maintain and supporthemselves 

* Projects where changes after go-live are likely to happen 

* Internal work portals 

* Process-oriented applications 

* Integrations applications 

* Applications that require data-management 

* Applications that replace Excel applications 

* Applications that have integrations with other platforms and system(like SAP) 

* Projects that are going to replace a legacy application 

* Any new solutions where the data is also going to be stored in thapplication 

* Extensions of System of Record (ERP/PLM/MES etc.) 

**Which type of projects would Mendix potentially not be the perfecfit for? **

Even though you can build almost anything with Mendix, especially witthe extensibility of the platform using Java, Mendix might not be thperfect fit for every application. Below are some examples oapplications where additional work needs to be done. 

* Games (as Mendix is aimed to build business applications) 

* Content Management Systems, but Mendix can integrate well witexisting CMS for creating CMS portals and such 

* Data warehouse applications, similar to CMS, Mendix can integratwell with existing data warehouse applications 

* Enterprise Service Bus applications. When the main purpose is tconnect applications with other applications, without addinbusiness value/logic, Mendix might not be the best fit 

* Applications with heavy mathematical calculations, but Mendix woulbe a good layer on top of an AI solution or calculation engine thacompute statistical models or data analytics 

* Web portals with more than 10,000 concurrent users 

* Mobile applications with more than 100,000 concurrent users 

* Applications where the main goal is to visualize data 

## Lecture 3.5 Define Application Valu
<span class="mark"\[Lecture Resource Value Template for CustomerPPT)</spa
By thoroughly defining the application’s purpose and value, yoprovide a clear roadmap for development, aligning the project witorganizational goals, and setting the stage for successfuimplementation and adoption. What will help you do that is trying tthink along these lines:

1.  **Business value proposition:**

* Clearly articulate the value proposition of the application. Asyourself: What problem does this application solve? Whaspecific business process or pain point does it address? Hodoes it contribute to the organization's success? What benefitwill it bring to the business, such as cost savings, revenugeneration, or improved customer satisfaction?

2.  **User experience and satisfaction:**

* Identify the target audience or users who will benefit from thapplication. Understanding the end-users helps in tailoring thapplication to their needs.

* Consider the user experience as a critical aspect of thapplication's value. An intuitive and user-friendly interfacenhances user satisfaction and adoption.

* Value is often derived not just from functionalities but alsfrom how easily and effectively users can accomplish theitasks.

3.  **Efficiency and productivity:**

* Assess how the application improves operational efficiency anproductivity. Identify areas where manual processes can bautomated, reducing errors and saving time.

* Highlight any potential cost savings or resource optimizatioachieved through the application.

4.  **Innovation and competitive advantage:**

* If applicable, emphasize how the application introduceinnovative solutions or features that set your organizatioapart from competitors.

* Consider how the application positions the organization fofuture growth and adaptation to changing market conditions.

5.  **Adaptability and scalability:**

* Highlight the application's adaptability to changing businesneeds and its scalability to accommodate future growth. valuable application is one that can evolve with thorganization.

6.  **Measurable objectives:**

* Establish measurable objectives to gauge the success of thapplication. Define key performance indicators (KPIs) that wilhelp evaluate its impact on business processes, efficiency, oother relevant metrics.

* Measurable objectives provide a basis for assessing thapplication's effectiveness and return on investment.

7.  **Alignment with organizational goals:**

* Confirm that the application purpose aligns with the overalgoals and vision of the organization. It should contributpositively to the strategic direction of the company.

* Understand how the application fits into the larger ecosystem oorganizational processes and systems.

You can also try filling in a template such as this one (you can finthis template attached in the Resources box at the top of this page):

## Lecture 3.6  Set up Deployment Architecture and Resource
Mendix applications can be deployed in different ways, mainly:

1.  Publi
2.  Privat
3.  On-premis
**Mendix Public Cloud** is the default deployment option and has thadvantage of being a fully integrated solution, with easy setting uand administrating. When developing your first application and ithere are no specific (private) cloud constraints, it makes sense tchoose the user friendly Mendix Cloud option. Within Mendix Cloudthere are options for multi-tenant cloud environments ansingle-tenant cloud environments. Deploying to Mendix Cloud gives yothe shortest time-to-value.

Mendix can also be deployed to any cloud platform which supports version of Cloud Foundry. With **Mendix for Private Cloud**, you cachoose the cloud provider of your preference, e.g. your own Azure oAWS infrastructures. If there already is access to an on-premishosting environment, Mendix can also be deployed on-premise.

When setting up your deployment strategy, it is important to look athe features that are needed, as some features that rely on the targeplatform can work differently.

If your organization is deploying on **Private Cloud or on-prem**please **make sure that you are ready to take on the effort anresponsibility of managing all hosting and support of the applicatiodeployments**.

For a list of all the deployment options that are available, see:
[https://docs.mendix.com/developerportal/deploy/](https://docs.mendix.com/developerportal/deploy/). 

Some highlights to consider:

**Mendix Public Cloud:**

* Pros: Fast and easy, all hosting is taken care of.  It has the besutilization rate for your infrastructure allowing you to maintaioptimal flexibility and convert your capital investment intoperational expenses. This option is supported by Mendix and it ithe most optimized cloud to run Mendix applications.

* Cons: Some organizations don’t allow shared cloud usage and requirair-gapped or private-cloud option
**Mendix Private Cloud:**

* Pros: Your DevOps team has complete control over applicatiodeployment and application lifecycle, with centralizemanagement. It is cloud agnostic, and you can choose on-premise oyour chosen cloud provider.

* Cons: Requires your own experienced staff to set up and maintaiwith reduced Mendix Support due to lack of access and visibility.

For Private deployment , **please be ready to start that procesimmediately in order to avoid development and go-live date delays**. 

See below for Private Cloud responsibility matrix:

style="width:6.5in;height:2.69648in" /

## Lecture 3.7 Review Options for Development Resources (Who Will Build Your First App?)

With Mendix, you have multiple options to choose from for thdevelopment of your applications:

1.  **In-house development**

1.  Train and/or hire Mendix developers to develop and support alyour Mendix applications.

When training in-house, we recommend choosing individuals who eithehave a traditional development background or have some understandinof OOP (object-oriented programming).  We’ve also seen individualwithout a technical background succeed if they have the righproblem-solving mindset!  Beyond the technical side, you also want tlook for individuals who can provide consulting to your businesteam. Mendix development is quick and Agile, and you need someone whcan speak to not only the technical side of Mendix but also thbusiness side at the same time in order to prevent projecbottlenecks.

1.  **Mendix partner**

1.  Bring in one of our certified Mendix partners to support youapp development.  Our directory of partners is liste[here](https://developerprofiles.mendix.com/link/partneroverview)but your Mendix team is a great resource to identify a good fifor you.

This can be a great option to get your project kick-started, or if yohave no future goals of building out your internal development team.

1.  **Mendix Expert Services**

1.  Our team of experts are here to support you! We have manoptions for enabling your team and helping you quickldemonstrate the power of Mendix.

Choosing Expert Services is the right option if you plan on buildinout your internal team and need enablement and support alongsidapplication development.  Expert Services can help prove the value othe Mendix internally while simultaneously coaching your team on hoto continue with the application(s).

1.  **Hybrid**

1.  You can simultaneously grow your in-house team and supplemenwith a Mendix partner and/or our Expert Services tea
Regardless of which option you choose, we always recommend that aleast one person internally has been trained on Mendix and itechnically capable of directing the project.  Outsourcing evertechnical role creates a siloed development team that does not trulunderstand your business needs.

## Lecture 4.1 Introduction to Agil
**What is the Agile Framework?**

Defining and honing your development process is a critical factor iprogram success. By nature of low-code, **the [AgilFramework](https://www.mendix.com/agile-framework/) is the best way twork with Mendix.**

Understanding how to work in Agile allows organizations to [staresponsive tchange](https://s2.bl-1.com/h/i/dtfq477y/xKsSFL1?url=https://www.mendix.com/blog/design-thinking-vs-agile-combine-problem-finding-problem-solving-better-outcomes/)
and reduce time-to-market by nearly 50%. Mendix highlights thesbenefits by providing capabilities such as sprints, story managementand integrated feedback management within the platform itself.

In the Academy, you can find an [Agile Awareness learninpath](https://academy.mendix.com/link/paths/110/Agile-Awareness)
that you can use to train your team in the Agile Framework and how iwill define your Mendix journey. 

## Lecture 4.2 Identify Your First Mendix Project Tea
This section addresses how you set up your first Mendix Project Team.
Ensuring you have the right people in the right roles is a criticastep in successfully getting started. Everyone participating should binterested and enthusiastic about learning how to leverage thipowerful platform, how to constantly improve collaboration and bespractices across roles and groups within the BizDevOps model, and hothe work they’ll be doing will bring value to the end users and thoverall organization.

**Setting up your Agile Scrum team**

To work in Mendix, we recommend working in an Agile Scrum Team that ialready familiar with the Agile Framework (if needed, refer to thi[Agile Awareness LearninPath)](https://academy.mendix.com/link/paths/110/Agile-Awareness).
This framework allows development teams to collaborate better, responto change, and continuously incorporate user feedback.

It’s important to have small cross-functional teams to make sure thaknowledge of all aspects is available within the team with all rolebeing covered. If needed, a person can take on multiple roles as lonas they have the skills, expertise, and time to commit to each role.
Ideal Scrum Teams are composed of 5-7 people, never exceeding nine folarger enterprises. 

Getting all the required knowledge in each team might be difficulwhile keeping your team small, efficient, and aligned. Mendiconsiders a Scrum team as a juncture of a **core team** an**accelerators**. 

**Core Team:**

* **Product Owner (PO):** responsible for defining the direction of project. They have a clear understanding of what the business anusers need from the product being developed and the value to bdelivered. They translate these needs to the Scrum team. The PO:

* Is a liaison between the business and the development team tbuild, prioritize, and manage the backlog to drive productioforward.

* Ensures the product being developed delivers the required valufor the business and users. 

* Accepts or rejects the completed wor
Ideal POs have these five key [skills &
characteristics.](https://www.mendix.com/blog/5-important-product-owner-skills-for-rapid-app-dev/)

* **Scrum Master (SM):** ensures that the team follows Agile bespractices and ioversees addressing and removing any productivitblockers that may come up. Essentially, the Scrum master is thauthority in Agile and Scrum to keep the team working togetheefficiently and effectively. SMs:

* Should be supportive leaders. 

* Help POs define the product’s value, plan work, and manage thbacklog. 

* Help developers self-organize.

* **Development Team:** consists of the people who actually build thapp. They are responsible for turning the requirements intfunctionality, based on the input provided by the Product Owner. Thdevelopment team:

* Is comprised of one or more people with the skills needed tbuild the product as envisioned by the PO.

* May be comprised of non-developers and traditional developeralike: architects, writers, technical BAs, designers, and othespecialized roles can all be part of the development team. 

* Work with the SM in the key Scrum activities of sprint planningsprint review, retrospectives and daily standups to keep theiassigned tasks on track with high-quality code during eacsprint, while working towards continuous improvement as a team.

**Accelerators:**

* **BAs or SMEs** get involved when a team requires detailed knowledgabout such subjects as UX/UI, QA, testing and integration. 

* **The Business Owner** is the primary stakeholder who is ultimatelresponsible and accountable for the end-result of the project anproduct including the actual value delivered. 

* **Stakeholders** are the end-users of the product under developmentrepresent strategical, tactical, and operational levels of thbusiness. 

Your team does not have to fit this exact mold, but it is importanthat all the responsibilities outlined here are covered to ensursuccess in your low-code program. Here’s a typical team structure:

## Lecture 4.3 Arrange Academy Training for Your Tea
As you begin to map out your Mendix team, it's important to establisa training plan. Properly training your Mendix team helps acceleratyour time to first value and promotes long-term low-code success. Ihelps each team member take charge of their own success and thoverall team’s success.

Take the time to familiarize yourself with the [MendiAcademy](https://academy.mendix.com/link/home). Here, we provide variety of guides and individual courses for various roles andiverse backgrounds to allow you to customize the learning journeappropriate for each team member and role. Once you are familiar witthe various guides, diverse topics and individual coursescreate a training plan with each team member based on their role anexperience. 

Here is a sample you can use as a template:

<img src="./markdown/media/image15.png"
style="width:6.5in;height:3.6519in" /

This will vary based on the specific people taking each role. A ScruMaster who used to be a full-stack developer could take the *CrasCourse* instead of the *Become a Rapid Developer* course. Your EA maneed to add *Native Mobile* or *Configure Advanced Security* for youparticular organization, project and team needs. Your Mendix team ihappy to help create your training plan.

**Mendix Certificates **

## Lecture 4.4 Organize Your Program Kick-Of
The program kick-off is important to hold before the project kick-ofas this meeting ensures alignment across all groups and team memberinvolved, from leadership to the development team, on goals, visionand value.  This meeting sets the foundation for bridging business anIT as you begin your Mendix journey.

**Who should be there?**

Make sure to include the relevant business and IT leaders, projecteam members, other stakeholders, Mendix and/or Mendix partner teamembers. If your executive sponsor could also be there, that would bamazing.

**What’s the agenda?**

A sample agenda of a successful program kickoff can include:

* A round of introduction
* Why Mendix was chose
* Business and IT alignment on:

* Organizational challenges and needs Mendix is solving (this iwhere your low-code vision will be very important — you alwayneed to be able to tie Mendix work back to the larger businesneeds)

* An overview of Mendix vision and strategy for your organizatio
* Goals and success at both the organizational and projeclevel
* Important milestones 

* Value measurement and impac
* Identify initial concerns or challenges and build mitigatioplans(s)

* Establish a cadence for this group to meet going forward for business review - quarterly, every other month, monthly, etc.

## 4.5 Summar
Amazing, you should have kicked-off your Mendix Program by now! Durinthis phase you:

* Made sure the right Expert Leads and Stakeholders needed for youMendix program are involved.

* Familiarized with the agile framework and its benefits, and decidewhether or not to use this way of working.

* Built your first Mendix project team and arranged Academy traininbased on their role and needs.

* Planned a successful program kick-off.

You are now ready to move to the next phase. Good job! 

# Module 5: Governance and Control in Mendi
## Module introduction (module tile): 

In this module, you will get a quick view on the features we offer tincorporate governance in your process. We will show you in detaiwhich of these you need to configure at the start, so the platforsupports your organisation’s onboarding.

## Learning Objective
Now that you have kicked-off your Mendix Program, it’s time tfamiliarize with the features Mendix offers to incorporate governance iyour process.

By the end of this module, you will be able to:

* Recognize the options Mendix offers to tailor the platform to youspecific governance need
* Identify the required steps to Configure the Platform in ControCente
## Lecture 5.1 Introduction to Governance in Mendi
Low-code governance is about having oversight and maintaining controover both a landscape of apps and individual app development. Iprovides guardrails for your development process  
and brings resources together to achieve the enterprise’s objectives.
Increase accountability,  
increase transparency, and get the most ROI out of what your teambuild and deploy.  
It will help you maximize business value at acceptable risk and cost.
Knowing the broad strokes capabilities of the Mendix platform early ohelps in getting solid early successes.

When you start, the governance responsibility will probably be in thhands of your Mendix admin, but as your Mendix landscape grows you mawant to define a Center of Excellence. Admins can use Control Centera dashboard that gives you an overview of various company activitieon the Mendix platform, to manage many of the aspects of landscapgovernance.  
<img src="./markdown/media/image17.png"
style="width:6.25in;height:3.33333in" /

There are several advanced capabilities in the Control Center to helyou manage your app landscape as it grows.

* [Dashboard](https://docs.mendix.com/control-center/dashboard/)
provides insight into some KPIs of how your company is advancing.

* [Apps](https://docs.mendix.com/control-center/apps/) provides easvisibility into all apps, environments, their deployment statustechnical contact, version, and more.

* [Healtdashboard](https://docs.mendix.com/control-center/application-health-dashboard/)
provides an insight into the running status of your app landscape.

* [Entitlements](https://docs.mendix.com/control-center/entitlements/)
shows the resources you’ve bought and used.

* You can add, resize or remove environments in the [Deployeapps](https://docs.mendix.com/control-center/deployed-apps/) view.

* Additional curation settings are available fo[Marketplace](https://docs.mendix.com/control-center/private-marketplace/)[Portfolios](https://docs.mendix.com/control-center/portfolios/)and [DatCatalog](https://docs.mendix.com/control-center/catalog-admin/)which apply to all your developers.

New capabilities are released regularly, so exploring Control Centeregularly is always a good idea!

But as you can tell from the slide below, governance touches manaspects of the development cycle and it’s not just confined to controcenter.

<img src="./markdown/media/image18.png"
style="width:6.36055in;height:3.28628in" /

If you would like to learn more about our governance features, you cacheck out the [Control CenteGuide,](https://docs.mendix.com/control-center/) [Control centelearninpath](https://academy.mendix.com/link/paths/116/Govern-and-Scale-your-App-Landscape-with-Mendix-Control-Center)or the Mendix documentation. You probably already involved your subjecmatter experts while you were evaluating Mendix, so they might want tdo a deeper dive.

A lot of these options will become more relevant for you as you scalyour Mendix portfolio, so for now, we will just point to a couple of kesettings that are important for getting started and launching your firsapp.

## Lecture 5.2 Configure the Platform in Control Cente
The Mendix platform has a few options to tailor the platform to youspecific governance needs. 

**Claim additional email domain **<img src="./markdown/media/image19.png"
style="width:0.22222in;height:0.22222in" alt="direct hit" / 
<img src="./markdown/media/image20.png"
style="width:5in;height:2.19792in" /

If your company has more than one email domain, all your email domainshould be claimed, such as: MyCompany.com, MyCompany.nlMyCompany-SpecialUnit.com etc. This is to ensure all users that do signup with an email address on any of these domains all end-up in thsame ‘company’ on the Mendix platform. If you don’t do this from thstart, your users may create projects in different ‘companies’/tenanton the Mendix platform, which is hard to govern and may requircumbersome merging activities later.

[You can read more about thathere.](https://docs.mendix.com/control-center/company-settings/#company-email-domains)

**Assign a security contact**  
<img src="./markdown/media/image21.png"
style="width:3.50864in;height:1.47929in" / 
Provide a specific **Security Contact** who is informed if there arcritical security issues with the Mendix platform anplatform-supported Marketplace components. Mendix strongly recommendapplying a team email address or a functional mailbox instead of personal individual email address.

Your security contact person(s) may want to subscribe the [MendiSecuritAdvisories](https://docs.mendix.com/releasenotes/security-advisories/)
to get familiar with the process around security fixes.

[Additionareading](https://docs.mendix.com/control-center/company-settings/#security-contact)

**Define company brand and description**
<img src="./markdown/media/image19.png"
style="width:0.22222in;height:0.22222in" alt="direct hit" / 
<img src="./markdown/media/image22.png"
style="width:5in;height:3.63542in" / 
On the **Company Brand** page, you can upload, edit, or remove **Company Logo**. The company logo uploaded here will appear acrosthe platform where it is used. For instance, it will be displayed oyour published Marketplace content.

[Additionareading](https://docs.mendix.com/control-center/company-brand/)

**Setup IDP or SSO for access to the Mendix platform**
<img src="./markdown/media/image23.png"
style="width:0.22222in;height:0.22222in" alt="direct hit" /

It is recommended that you [set-uSSO](https://docs.mendix.com/control-center/security/set-up-sso-byoidp/)
between the Mendix platform and your corporate IDP such as MicrosofEntra ID (f.k.a. Azure AD) or Okta.  This will put your IDP in controof how users are authenticated before they can access your content othe Mendix platform. Leavers (former employees) will not be able tlogin. Your platform users get the convenience of Single Sign-Onrather than yet-another-password. See also our [BYOIDblog](https://www.mendix.com/blog/introducing-byoidp-bring-your-own-identity-provider/).

Optionally, you may set up access rules in your IDP to control whicof your employees can and cannot work on the Mendix platform. As wencourage collaboration in multi-disciplined teams, be careful not tbe too restrictive or not apply any restriction at all. For examplepotential end-users of Mendix apps may want to contribute tdevelopment teams. In a later stage you can set up restrictive accesrules as you start putting more business-critical IPs in the logic oyour Mendix apps.

### Setup password polic
If you don’t enable SSO, you will want to specify if the usepasswords expire or not. If you do not want the passwords to expiretoggle **Passwords of company members never expire** to **On**.  


##  Lecture 5.3 Summar
Now that you know how Mendix can be tailored to your own governancneeds, you are ready to get your first project started! You will finall the useful information to do this in the following module.

# Module 6: Get Started With Your First Projec
## Module introduction (module tile): 

In this module, you will get all the information you need to know thelp you get started with your first Mendix project.

## Learning Objective
It’s now time to begin your first Mendix project! How exciting!

By the end of this module, you will be able to: 

* Organize your first project kick-of
* Create your projec
* Ensure project access for all of your team member
* Set up the agile way of workin
* Define requirements for your first project 

* Identify continuous collaboration that you can leverage througMendi
## Lecture 6.1 Organize Your First Project Kick-of
Now that the program is properly kicked off, the next step is torganize the kick-off for your first project. Kick-off meetings are great way to communicate key project information to your team and givthem an opportunity to ask questions. You might also want to have youkey stakeholders in the same (physical or virtual) room. 

A sample agenda for a successful project kickoff might include:

* Introduction: Make sure everyone knows each other.

* The background of the project i.e. why are you doing it in the firsplace? (Go back to your application value definition and simplpresent the most important points to your team).

* What is the project scope: You might not have your MVP scope definein the kick-off meeting and that’s ok. What is important is to hava clear understanding of the problem you are solving and what thmost crucial aspect of that problem to tackle first.

* Who’s doing what: Here every team member should have a cleaunderstanding of their roles and responsibilities (in the context othe scrum framework as well as in general).

* How are you going to work together: Establish your agile ritual(standups, refinements, reviews, retrospectives) and decide whshould be attending and how often. In general, all team members wilbe coming to all the rituals, but your stakeholders will not. Thonly thing that is super important for your stakeholders to attenis the sprint review.

* What does success look like: How will you know if you have deliverevalue? These could be project milestones, but also metrics you woullike to influence.

## Lecture 6.2 Create Your Project and Make Sure Everyone Has Acces
Anyone can sign up to the Mendix platform using their business emaiaddress, so there is no need to on-board a specific list of users. Althey need to do is go t[signup.mendix.com](http://signup.mendix.com) and use threlevant company email domain (any from the list you have added ilecture 5.2). 

If you are working with implementation partners, you need to decid**how to give those team members access to your app projects**.

You may take one of the following approaches:

* One possibility is to invite external users to your app projectusing their external email address (e.g. Joan@MyMendixPartner.com).

* Another possibility is to create accounts for them in your company’Entra ID (or similar IdP such as Okta).

**Create your first app!**

And now that everyone has a Mendix account, this is the moment you’vall been waiting for — it’s time to actually create your first app!
Anyone from your team can click the Create App button on the Mendiplatform, just make sure they are logged in with an email address froyour company domain.

<img src="./markdown/media/image24.png"
style="width:6.5in;height:3.16367in" /

Once the project is created, everyone from the team should get accesto it as well as their appropriate role. This is the overview of thdefault project roles on the Mendix platform: 

<img src="./markdown/media/image25.png"
style="width:6.5in;height:3.02148in" /

## Lecture 6.3 Setting up the Agile Way of Workin
Sprint Zero is all about laying the groundwork for a successfuproject by focusing on planning and preparation rather thaimmediately jumping into development. It might seem like this is whole lot of process while the team is ready to get to building, buespecially for your first project, it is crucial to set up the righprocess, get everyone comfortable with it and define the initiarequirements — this will absolutely speed you up very soon. 

Let’s start by setting up your agile ways of working. You might havdefined some things already in your project kick-off, so you can starby revisiting that. Moving forward, you also need to determine whicAgile practices will become your organizational standard: this coulbe Scrum (the Mendix platform is optimized for Scrum at team level)Kanban, or other variants. Creating a standard doesn't mean that alteams will be forced to work in exactly the same way, but having shared set of practices will increase mobility between teams. The morfamiliar and standardized this methodology is across youorganization, the tighter the collaboration will be amongst teams ateam members understand expectations and roles. 

However, it should be noted that your agile methodology should remailightweight and flexible to keep administrative burden as low apossible while maximizing the benefits to your organization. The waof working should suit the team's needs, so that they can get the besout of themselves. Take a pragmatic approach so that this can bdiscovered progressively. 

Regardless of Agile methodology, some of the practices that you caconsider standardizing are: 

* Sprint 0 (or design sprints) 

* Daily stand-up
* Sprint plannin
* Backlog refinemen
* Product demo
* Team retrospective
Care should be taken to incorporate feedback from team retrospectiveand other Agile ceremonies into your standards as part of youcontinuous improvement process. That includes reviewing and analyzinany shortcuts taken or other deviations from the standard process tunderstand why it was necessary and potentially consider adapting youstandards or putting another appropriate measure in place.

Development teams can work most efficiently if requirements arclearly described (e.g. in user stories), to estimate the effort animplementation. Because of this, it is important that you choose tool in which these can be tracked. The Mendix platform offers collaborative tool calle[Epics](https://www.mendix.com/blog/mendix-projects-and-the-wizardry-of-epics/)in which this is possible. Here you can manage the backlog, epicscreate user stories, and of course sprints. Both the Agile and Kanbamethods are supported.

An organization that is familiar with the Agile way of working willikely already use related tools, such as JIRA. JIRA is often used foScrum projects, which is why it is now possible to link JIRA to youMendix Project. The Scrum Master of the project can choose betweeEpics or Jira in the Settings part of the project navigation, in thProject Management tab.

<img src="./markdown/media/image26.png"
style="width:6.5in;height:5.54531in" /

Make sure that the tool and process you choose supports closcollaboration between the product owner, developers, users, and othestakeholders. The tool should enable clear visibility and tracinbetween user stories, implementation, feedback, and deployments. Teamembers unfamiliar with your chosen tool may also need additionatraining to maximize use of the tool.

## Lecture 6.4 Defining Requirement
If at all possible, make sure the development team talks to the futurend-users — this is what sprint zero is for. The team needs tunderstand what the app will be used for, what problem it is supposeto solve, how that problem is being solved now, and what can bimproved.

When defining requirements, try to not take things at face value. Youstakeholders might have a clear list of requirements, but always starby making sure that you have a shared understanding of the proble(this is what the part about defining application value was for). Thelook at the various ways you can help solve that problem — maybe thafirst idea is not always the best one, and the way things have alwaybeen done can be adapted for maximum efficiency.

Once the team has enough information, they should list the kefeatures and functionalities that the application will offer. Thicould include data entry forms, workflow automation, reporting toolsor any other capabilities that align with the application's purpose.
Think about what the user needs to be able to do and how. 

Next step is to prioritize features based on their importance tachieving the primary goal. Remember, a minimum viable product is alabout achieving that initial value. Just because something is not part of that scope, does not mean it’s considered unimportant or thait will not get done. Often things your stakeholders, or eveend-users consider crucial are things they can probably live withoufor a couple of weeks. And if done right, your team will have a rhyththat ensures they consistently continue delivering value.

## Lecture 6.5 Standard Requirements and Reusabilit
There will always be requirements that are repeated for each and everapplication you build, things like access management or standardizenavigation, or maybe things that each app you build needs to have whicare specific to your business. If you already see things like that, notthem down and think about whether it makes sense to add them to youstandard company app template, or maybe to invest in creating a reusablcomponent, which will save you time in the long run. It's also ok tmove quickly for this first app and look into reusability later, some oour most successful customers started like that!

Here is a couple of topics to keep in mind:

**End user login**

Every app will need a way for your end users to get access to it. Wadvise to use the [OIDC SSmodule](https://docs.mendix.com/appstore/modules/oidc/) for (B2E)
apps you are developing. This is a sensible default as it is the easiesand most flexible approach for Single Sign-On and is supported bMicrosoft’s Entra ID and most other IdPs.  As an alternative you maadvise [SAML](https://docs.mendix.com/appstore/modules/saml/)
(e.g. for regulated B2C-apps) o[LDAP](https://docs.mendix.com/appstore/modules/ldap/) foon-prem apps or the [Forgot MPassword](https://docs.mendix.com/appstore/modules/forgot-password/)
module for non-SSO apps.

**Familiarize with the Marketplace**

Low-code development may be fast, but using modules or content frothe Marketplace may even be faster. You may find modules relevant tyour portfolio or your first app in particular and create a shortlisfor your teams.  Marketplace content may be supported by MendixMendix partners or by the Mendix community.

## Lecture 6.6 Familiarize Yourself With Continuous Collaboration Through Mendi
One of the core values of the Mendix platform is continuoucollaboration between business and IT. We have already shown you hothat works in practice when it comes to aligning on wider strategiobjectives (your low-code vision), program goals as well as youproject goals. Now it’s time to see how it all works throughout thapplication development lifecycle. 

<img src="./markdown/media/image27.png"
style="width:6.5in;height:3.65625in" /

It all starts with your portfolio. You have already added a couple oinitiatives in it, but now that you have the MVP scope of your firsapplication, add it in as a separate initiative and describe or linto documentation showing what needs to be delivered exactly and why. 

You also have your application, so now you can link it to thinitiative. To do this, you just need to select *Edit initiative* anstart typing your app name to select it from the dropdown.

<img src="./markdown/media/image28.png"
style="width:6.5in;height:5.88743in" /

If you are using Epics as your agile planning tool, you will be ablto link the right epics to this initiative. This means that anyone whopens that initiative in Portfolio Management will be able to sedevelopment progress on the epic level.

<img src="./markdown/media/image29.png"
style="width:6.5in;height:9.48723in" /

Another important part of collaboration in the application developmenlifecycle is the collaboration between the development team and theiend users. Mendix makes that super easy using the feedback module.
Your app users just need to click the *Feedback* button in your apand tell you what they like, need or miss, and your development teawill be able to immediately respond. Once your app is live, the teawill be able to set up a mini-survey to ask for user satisfaction, oget more targeted input by asking specific questions. Here you caread more on [the importance of user feedback for applicatiodevelopment](https://www.mendix.com/blog/how-to-collect-and-analyze-user-feedback-in-your-app/).

## Lecture 6.7 The Development Process Itself and Why That’s Not a Part of This Guid
We have created this guide in order to help anyone who is in charge oimplementing Mendix in their organization to hit the ground running.
The end goal of this phase is to bring your first app to life, but iyou are working on managing the Mendix program, odds are you will nobe the person actually developing the app itself. Rather, your job ito enable the set up of everything, focus on the 5 P’s, and empowethe development team to focus on development only. 

There are many dedicated resources on the platform to help new (oseasoned developers) get the most out of Mendix.So for the sake oyour time, this guide’s length, and your sanity, let us skip a festeps ahead and pretend that the application is now almost ready.

## Lecture 6.8 Summar
By now most probably your first application has been developed and iready for launch! You’ve learned how to kick off your project and havensured access for all stakeholders involved. You’ve also laid thfoundation for establishing an Agile way of working and made surthere is a clear understanding of project requirements shared amongsall stakeholders. Also, you are aware of what tools are in place tsupport continuous collaboration that you can leverage through Mendix.
Time to move on and prepare for launching your first application!

# Module 7: Launching Your First Applicatio
## Module introduction (module tile): 

You’ve come a long way, and it is time to launch your firsapplication. This module covers all you need to know at this stage. 

## Learning Objective
Well done, you’ve gone a long way and learned a lot through thprocess! It’s time to launch your first application. Exciting! 

By the end of this module, you will be able to: 

* Identify the different options available to test your applicatio
* Describe the ways to promote your applicatio
* Recognize the importance and options to maintain and upgrade youapplicatio
## Lecture 7.1 Deploy Your Applicatio
### Deploy your application to the Mendix Clou
Deploying your application to the Mendix Cloud is a simple processthat will give you access to all the features and services in thMendix Cloud. It requires only a few steps to set it up, which yoonly need to do once for each application. Once the cloud settings oyour application is done, you can deploy and redeploy your applicatiowith just one click.  

Note that Mendix also offers [other deploymenoptions](https://docs.mendix.com/releasenotes/developer-portal/deployment/)
than the Mendix cloud e.g. to a private cloud if that’s a requirement.

### Obtain a licensed nod
You can deploy your application for free on the Mendix Cloud. Thes[Free Apps havlimitations](https://docs.mendix.com/developerportal/deploy/mendix-cloud-deploy/#free-app)
when it comes to run time, features and resources. You can publisFree Apps to test the Mendix platform, a specific feature of tquickly prototype an application to test an idea. Once you decide ttake your application to the next-level and start serious developmenon it, you will need to obtain a licensed node, so this is somethinyou will need to do before your launch.

If you have an existing contract that allows for more licensed nodesyou can [request a new licensenode](https://docs.mendix.com/developerportal/deploy/licensing-apps/#31-obtaining-a-licensed-node).
If you don’t have a contract, or if your contract doesn’t allow fomore licensed nodes, contact your Customer Success Manager.

### Link your application to your licensed nod
If you have a licensed node available, you can link your applicatioto this licensed node. If your application was published as a FreApp, you will have to unlink the application from the Free Apenvironment first. This will delete all data on that Free Apenvironment. So, before you unlink your Free App, [back up thdata](https://docs.mendix.com/developerportal/deploy/licensing-apps/#backing-up)
first, if you require it.

If you have backed up your data, you can [unlink youapplication](https://docs.mendix.com/developerportal/deploy/licensing-apps/#unlink-free)
from the Free App environment.

When your app is unlinked from a Free App environment, you can link ito a licensed node. By linking it to a licensed node, you get accesto all the features of the Mendix Cloud, such as one-click deploymenfrom Studio Pro and our platform, log management, backups managemenand monitoring tools.

### Set node permission
Once you have linked your application to a licensed node, your teaneeds to determine what users can perform what actions on the node.
Who can configure an environment, who can deploy to an environmentwho has access to the logs of an environment, etc. All of that icontrolled by [nodpermissions](https://docs.mendix.com/developerportal/deploy/node-permissions/).
By default, only the Technical Contact of a node has permissions tperform any action on the licensed node. The Technical Contact cagrant permissions to other members of the app team.

Granting permissions to team members is dependent on your deploymenstrategy and process: do you have DevOps teams where the developeralso deploy and monitor the apps? Or does your company have separatOps teams, where the deployment is done by people other than thdevelopers? You can set node permissions for each of the environmentof your node, so you can grant developers to deploy the app to thTest environment, but restrict deployment permissions for thProduction environment to a smaller team.

### Set cloud setting
When the node permissions are set up, you can start configuring youcloud settings. This can be done by any team member with the correcpermissions. Changing your cloud settings is not mandatory, as most osettings are set for you by default in the Mendix Cloud, but in somcases you want to customize them to tailor the end user experience oto adhere to company standards.

Things can you can customize for your applications in the Mendix Clouinclude:

* [Studio Pro deploymentarget](https://docs.mendix.com/developerportal/deploy/studio-deployment-settings/#2-selecting-the-target-environment)

* [Custodomains](https://docs.mendix.com/developerportal/deploy/custom-domains/)

* [HTTheaders](https://docs.mendix.com/howto/security/best-practices-security/#adding-http-header)

* [Path-based accesrestrictions](https://docs.mendix.com/developerportal/deploy/access-restrictions/)

* [Environmenvariables](https://docs.mendix.com/developerportal/deploy/environments-details/#custom-environment-variables)

* [Services](https://docs.mendix.com/developerportal/deploy/environments-details/#services)such as [the Event Brokeservice](https://docs.mendix.com/appstore/services/business-events/#mendix-event-broker)

### Deploy your applicatio
Once you have linked and configured your Mendix Cloud node, which yoonly have to do once, you can start deploying your application to thMendix Cloud. It is recommended that you deploy any new version oyour application to the Test or Acceptance environment of youapplication first for testing, before deploying it to the Productioenvironment.

There are multiple ways to deploy your application to the MendiCloud, so there is always a deployment flow that fits your needs. Yo(or your team) can get a complete overview of those [in this docpage](https://docs.mendix.com/developerportal/deploy/mendix-cloud-deploy/#deploy-app-mendix-cloud).

## Lecture 7.2 Test Your Applicatio
Mendix has a module that allows developers to write and execute UniTests: the UnitTesting module in Marketplace. With the UnitTestinmodule, critical parts of the application can be tested.

There are a variety of tools available for testing, froMendix-supported ones to third-party ones. Read more about [TesAutomation and QualitAssurance](https://www.mendix.com/evaluation-guide/app-lifecycle/test-automation-quality-assurance/).

Aside from unit tests, performance tests can also be performed witmultiple third-party tools, such as JMeter, BlazeMeter and LoadRunne– all of which are capable of testing the performance of your Mendiapplication.

After go-live, the Mendix Cloud offers metrics and logs to providinsights into application performance and can help track down bugs.

## Lecture 7.3 User Acceptance Testin
Before launching your first application, it is important to thoroughltest the application, not just in terms of bug bashing, but also tmake sure it fulfills end user needs. That is why User AcceptancTests should be performed before any go-live. What does that mean?
It’s simple — always get your end users to actually try out the apbefore the go-live. This will give you the chance to catch anlast-minute bugs and make sure your app is meeting (and exceeding)
user expectations. 

Mendix feedback module makes it super easy to organize user acceptanctests, all you need to do is to select the environment you want to dthis in, make sure the feedback module is set up there, inform youend-users that you need their help and give them information on how tlog in and how to provide feedback (maybe you want them to tesspecific scenarios you would give them on advance, or just let theplay around themselves and give feedback on anything they notice mighneed to be changed). Then your development team will be able to fiany issues and respond to questions that might arise. Keep in minthat they might need extra time to tackle this feedback, so be suryou get user input at least a week before your planned go live datepreferably even longer. 

## Lecture 7.4 Launch and Promote Your Applicatio
Congratulations! If you made it this far, you’ve most likely launcheyour first Mendix app and have already started delivering value foyour organization. You’ve probably tried doing things a bidifferently than before and your team, as well as your wholorganization, learned a lot along the way. To ensure continuesuccess, here are a couple of things you need to think about now.

**Celebrate your first launch**

Yes, you absolutely need to celebrate. Here are some tips to maximizthe impact of your internal celebration: 

* Throw a party and invite as many people as possible, not just youdevelopment team. 

* Host the party in a central location so that other departments taknotice. 

* People love cake. To be more specific: people love free cake. Ordea cake. One of our customers in the shipping industry made theicake look like a shipping container because their app increased thutilization of their containers. You could make your cake look lika volcano, because business is about to erupt. 

* Make sure your most senior sponsor is in the room to reinforce thimportance of low-code development. 

* Captivate your audience by presenting the astonishing results oyour project. Have the business show the demo.

* Here’s who you can consider inviting to celebrate with you: 

* Project tea
* Business stakeholders 

* Stakeholders from other lines of busines
* IT leader
* Mendix Expert Services or the Partner that helped guide the teathrough the projec
But it doesn’t stop there. You need to continue talking about youfirst success. This part might feel like shameless promotion, and imight not come naturally to you or your team, but trust us, it’s vitaand it works. Some of our most successful customers went on to shartheir success story in the form of a blog for your company website ointranet, a video, a podcast or at the very least a value one-pagethat can be shared across your organization. Trust us, it’s worth it.

## Lecture 7.5 After the Launc
**Establish a retrospective cadence **

To achieve this milestone, it’s first important to establish the goalof a retrospective. The retrospective should look back on the projecand review successes and lessons learned. 

1.  Did the project achieve its business goal? 

2.  Did you have the right people on the team? 

3.  How well was the business engaged in the process? 

Embrace all feedback, whether it’s perception or reality. Again, lethe business know they have a voice and that their input is vital timproving future projects. Seek their advice on how to develop a morstructured rapid application development approach that furtheenhances engagement and collaboration with other business units.

One of the most important questions to ask the business stakeholderin the retrospective is “What would you tell your friends/colleagueabout this project to make them enthusiastic?” This elevator pitch igreat fodder for internal feedback, with the goal of implementing thiapproach more broadly across the organization. To effectively engagthe business, you may have to reverse years of perception. The key iconstant communication and proof. Once business users see that yohave done what you said you would do — and that they can have significant impact on the project —they will quickly embrace this neapproac
Make sure to do a team retrospective as well, these are some of thpoints you can consider:

* What went well?

* What didn’t go well? 

* Who really excelled in the project and can take on the Mendideveloper lead role/advance their certification level?

* How can you use this information to refine your process for the nexproject?

**Document and measure the value of the application** 

Remember those goals you outlined when you initially defined the valuof your application? Now is the time to go back to them and see if yohave reached them or are on track to reach them.

It might take a bit of time to capture enough data to be able to draconclusions, but always make sure the value the app brought about icaptured. This might include things like generating additional revenuor maybe saving costs by sunsetting existing legacy apps, automatinpreviously manual processes, or simply delivering a new applicatiofaster than you would with traditional development. It could even bsomething like improving your customer satisfaction or engagement.
Whatever it is, make sure you have measured it and will continue tmeasure it. This will also be important when the time comes for you tdefine the value of your second and third app.

## Lecture 7.6 Maintain and Upgrade Your Application
**Platform: Maintaining your Mendix App**

After developing and publishing your first Mendix app, it's importanto put proper maintenance measures in place. [Establishing regular upgradpractice](https://www.mendix.com/wp-content/uploads/Your-Mendix-Upgrade-Guide-1.pdf)
