# Module 2: Get Familiar With the 5 P’s of the Digital Execution Practice
## Module introduction (module title): 

In this module you will learn about the 5 P’s of DigitalTransformation and their importance to your Mendix success. You willalso get an overview of the Mendix platform and learn where you canfind all the extra information you may need. 

## Learning Objectives
Let’s start with building the foundation of your Mendix knowledge!

By the end of this module, you will: 

* Assign your Mendix Admin 

* List the different components of the Mendix platform and explaintheir role
* Identify the three major stages of the Digital Execution Practiceand what each stage entails
* Describe the 5 P’s of the Digital Execution Practice and theirimportance to your long-term success

* List the available options you have for staying up to date withMendix
## Lecture 2.1 Assign Your Mendix Admin
First let’s get one admin (no pun intended) thing out of the way. Yourcompany needs **at least one Admin**. It might make sense for thefirst admin to be you and then you can easily assign as many otheradmins as you need.

So why do you need an admin? Your developers are able to create newapps, invite other users to their app teams, deploy apps, and inviteapp end-users to give feedback, among many other activities. Insightsinto these company activities are provided in [ControlCenter](https://controlcenter.mendix.com/index.html) in onecentral overview. You can read more about Control Center[here](/control-center/) or follow this[learningpath. ](https://academy.mendix.com/link/paths/116/Govern-and-Scale-your-App-Landscape-with-Mendix-Control-Center)

Do you already have at least one admin? If that’s the case, you cansee them on the list when you open [ControlCenter](https://controlcenter.mendix.com/index.html), and you canskip the rest of this lecture.

A **Mendix Admin** will normally be someone in the IT department ofyour company, and they will have full access to Control Center, whichwill give them visibility and essential controls to make sure the appsdeliver business value at acceptable cost and risk.  You can assignyour first Mendix Admin through [MendixSupport](https://support.mendix.com/hc/en-us/requests/new), justchoose "Standard Change: Assign Mendix Admin" from the dropdown. Thisfirst admin can then [add otheradmins](/control-center/company-settings/#3-mendix-admins).

## Lecture 2.3 Introduction to Digital Execution Practice (DEP): the 3 S’s and the 5 P’s
**The 3 S’s of Digital Execution Practice: Start, Structure andScale**

Your journey to innovation will go through three major stages:
**Start**, **Structure** and **Scale**. You are now in the **Start**
stage, where the goal is to lay the foundations for your innovationfactory. In Start, you want to develop applications that realize valuequickly. The reason for this is two-fold:

1.  You’ll be spending a lot of time building a team and putting thenecessary prerequisites in place in terms of infrastructure andprocess. Because of that... 

2.  You want quick wins. Quick wins are important because you’ll usethese to prove the value of your new approach. Celebrating yourfirst success will help you gain broader support around the company.

If the Start stage is about establishing and proving the benefits ofrapid application development, then **Structure** is about buildingout predictability and continuity. Structure is about growing fromyour first set of apps to a portfolio with a diverse array of appsaddressing multiple use cases, expanding your first team into multipleteams, and expanding your developer center. 

Structure is about taking the process of your first agile experiencethat you established in Start to a process that institutes shorterrelease cycles under strict governance. Structure is where you beginto formalize your rapid application development process — establishingan architecture, enabling continuous delivery, and creatinggovernance. By establishing predictability and stability, you’rebuilding the scaffolding for future successes.

In **Scale**, you have learned how to use Mendix to speed up and scaleout app development and start delivering real value for your business.
Your talent has been trained and activated in such a way that you canshift them around the organization to work on projects where theirskills are best put to use. You are applying greater automation toyour processes to efficiently and rapidly deliver and manage hundredsof applications with strategic impact. This includes automatingdeployment and maintenance to support a large portfolio, automatingquality assurance to proactively monitor the maintainability of yourprojects, and enabling greater reusability by establishing a privateapp store. With these capabilities in place, you maximize value andproductivity by creating distributed innovation capabilitiesthroughout the enterprise. You have achieved continuous productivityand efficiency.

**The 5 P’s of Digital Transformation**

Sounds great, right? But how do you get there? Step by step. There arefive major areas you will need to focus on. We call these the **5 P’sof Digital Transformation** and aligning the P’s (Portfolio, People,
Process, Platform, and Promotion) to your organization's digitalstrategy is crucial to your Mendix success. Let’s go over them one byone.

 {{< figure src="image/path" max-width=80% class="image-border"  >}}image4.png"
style="width:6.5in;height:3.53438in" /

## 2.3.1 Portfolio: Choosing a Use Case That Is Equally Meaningful and Doable
Getting your digital transformation program off the ground starts withidentifying the right projects and creating an application portfolioof quick wins in high-value initiatives.

Why quick wins?

Proving the value of a program—whether it’s through software thatallows your business to create a new channel of revenue or anapplication that saves employees time on an internal process—allowsyou to realize immediate success and justify a broader organizationalchange. A diversity of use cases is important here, to show that yourapplication portfolio can reach many different departments and addressa variety of needs.

And guess what? We have a tool to help you with that. Mendix PortfolioManagement gives you a way to identify, track, and plan out yourinitiatives. So, let's get started by creating your Portfolio board[here](https://portfolio.mendix.com/index.html). All you needto do is click on *Get Started* and then *Create your firstPortfolio*. 

 {{< figure src="image/path" max-width=80% class="image-border"  >}}image5.png"
style="width:6.5in;height:3.15859in" /

If you would like to learn more about how to manage your portfolio ofideas and applications, . You might also have done a portfolioworkshop with Mendix experts before, in which case, you may alreadyhave an Excel file with your list of initiatives that you can easilyimport into your brand new board. If not, we discuss your first appselection in more detail in Module 3.

## 2.3.2 People: Building a Strong Mendix Team
The people you choose for your teams are absolutely crucial to thesuccess of your digital execution program. You want to find the rightpeople with the right skills who are excited about and can commit timeand energy to the program, no matter their job title. 

A strong first Mendix team is more than just the number of people inthe room. Your first Mendix team should include a core developmentteam comprised of a combination of a professional developer — someonewith technical expertise — and a business developer — someone familiarwith the platform that can act as a power user if needed. The key isto have developers who can collaborate closely with end users,
bridging the gap between business needs and technical possibilities.
In the beginning, it’s highly likely that not all these people willcome from your own organization (we will further review the options inLecture 3.7), but this is an overview of all the higher level rolesyou will need sooner or later.

The following leadership roles are essential to the success of any newplatform or paradigm:

* **Executive Sponsors:** Success starts at the top, where seniorexecutive buy-in is a must. These are the top-level executives,
ideally representing both the Business/Operations and IT, who arewilling to be engaged periodically to provide oversight andsteering-committee level guidance. These people won’t necessarily beinvolved day-to-day, but they understand the big picture vision ofhow Mendix will help the enterprise achieve its digitaltransformation and low-code goals, how it fits to ‘play nicely’ withother technology stacks and tools like Microsoft’s ADO or PowerApps, and what the transformational value is expected. Your Mendixteam can work with these individuals to help understand, define, andrefine their role, the value proposition for high ROI, etc.

<!-- --

* **Program Owner:**  You need a person to lead the program andmandate/enable change; who generates excitement about the importanceof this transformation and can inspire people to *want* toparticipate. This person is directly responsible for the overallsuccess of the platform’s implementation, bringing impactful apps tofruition, ensuring value targets are defined and tracked, and thatthe teams are properly assigned and allocated for success. 

It’s common for Program Owners to work very closely with their MendixCSMs to define and implement success plans and to evolve those plansover time to ensure ever-increasing returns and solid value. Forsmaller organizations, this person may also be part of the Core Team;
for larger organizations, it’s common for this person to be a part ofthe Center of Excellence leadership team or to be a dedicated seniorresource overseeing global success. Areas of responsibility includeassurance of proper architectural and governance guidelines/adherence,
successful regional and global rollouts, successful teamgrowth/training/enablement plans, KPI definition and tracking, etc.  

* **Center of Excellence Lead (COE Lead):** Generally, largerorganizations implement a Mendix COE to help define and enforce goodgovernance, development, and enablement practices that can evolvewith the business and technological changes for overall platform andprogram success throughout the enterprise over time. The COE Leadensures the Mendix COE is properly staffed to support, oversee andenable development teams, and ensures the products produced are ofhigh-quality following best practices for high re-usability,
maintainability and return on investment. This person generally hassufficient senior-level technical and managerial skills to overseethe COE’s Enterprise and Solution Architects, DevOps technicalleads, trainers and mentors, and other experienced staff.

**Product owners** are key players to a successful program, becausethey’ll have in-depth knowledge of the business, the product, and itsusers, and will have insight into the value that it will create. Ifpossible, make sure that your first product owner comes from your ownorganization and is familiar with the problem you are setting out tosolve with your first application. Product owner is not really aleadership role, but the choice of a product owner is crucial for thesuccess of your first app, which is why we touch on it here. can POsare also a part of the agile scrum team, so we will mention them againin section 4.2.

**Architects** will help establish a target architecture,
infrastructure, and governance. 

Finally, an **application development manager** needs to spearhead theinitiative and drive the program and the cross-functional teams whowill deliver on those projects. 

**The blueprint to build your first Mendix team**

We’ve created the blueprint for building your first Mendix team,
assessing that team, and showing how it can grow and collaborate withthe business and other departments within your organization. 

**Find problem solvers** 

Find team members who care about solving business problems rather thanpeople who prefer to build solutions based on detailed requirements.
There will be many obstacles to overcome due to existing processes andthe culture of the business, so seek out people who have a “can-do”
attitude who can be change evangelists. 

Traditional developers (with experience in programming languages suchas C#, Python, Java, etc.) are usually very quick to grasp Mendix aswell. Here you might want to look for people who are moreoutcome-oriented and love adding new tools to their toolbox.

That said, don’t get too hung up on job roles — you also need peoplewho want to test their limit and have some technical proficiency, butalso understand business challenges. A host of individuals that we’veseen successfully make the transition come from business analysis, UX,
front-end web design, and business intelligence backgrounds. 

In the end, selecting the right team and arming them for success isthe cornerstone of success, not just for your first project but foryour entire rapid application development program. 

**A who’s who** 

It’s important to keep your team small as you build your Mendix Centerof Excellence (your central repository of development expertise,
reusable components, and governance guidance that business teams canaccess as they build their specialized solutions). With a small team,
you can deliver new applications quickly, avoiding much of themiscommunication and delays that often come with larger developmentteams. Smaller teams encourage productivity and creativity. Amazon CEOJeff Bezos’ “two pizza rule” states that you should never have ameeting where two pizzas couldn’t feed the entire group. The smallerthe team, the more room for brainstorming and peer review. 

**Mendix developers come with all types of skill-sets** 

Developers come from all parts of the business, not just IT. From yourhigh-code programmers, to your business-centric developers, to yourtech-savvy business analysts, low-code platforms let you build teamsof makers from all backgrounds. 

As the main action point here, start thinking about who you need tokick off building your first Mendix application and start talking tothem about it. Some names are probably coming to mind already and youwill get much more information on who you need exactly in **Lecture4.2 Identify Your First Mendix Project Team**.

## 2.3.3 Process: Building Repeatable Practices for Long-Term Outcomes
Successful digital execution means changing the way you work andestablishing rapid application development processes. Agilemethodologies like Scrum are a good starting point, splitting the workinto sprints and basing them off user stories, but you also need tochange from a traditional way of development and operations into aBizDevOps approach, which promotes close collaboration and sharedknowledge between the business team, developers, and operational team.
It ditches the division between those departments to get rid ofunnecessary knowledge silos that only disrupt the information flow.

**Minimum Viable Product**

One important concept to embrace for your process (if you haven’talready) is the **Minimum Viable Product (MVP)**. MVP is a version ofan application with just enough features to be usable by earlycustomers who can then provide feedback for future development. 

Minimum viable products are meant to be incomplete by nature, with thegoal of delivering value quickly, then figuring out next requirementsand iterating on them based on the input from actual users. Thisensures that the application will provide the right user experienceand achieve the goals you set. It is easier said than done, though,
and the change in the way of working takes a bit of time to get usedto. If you haven’t involved your end users into the process before, itmay feel like an extra task that is slowing you down but trust theprocess — getting their input early on will save you many costlychanges down the road. And just because something is not a part of theMVP, does not mean it won’t be delivered just a couple of days orweeks later, since this way of working enables lighting fastiterations!

**Put a governance structure in place** 

A core element to success is repeating it. Repeated success leads toand informs your governance around rapid application development. Youneed to define and implement processes and rules around applicationdevelopment that help you coordinate and control your applicationportfolio. 

Governance is creating a centralized hub where you establish bestpractices around agile and scrum, UI/UX, and guidelines around build,
deployment, and architecture as well as security/compliance. You’reassigning the people on your team responsibilities around these bestpractices. 

## 2.3.4 Platform: Tying All These Pieces Together With a Pure Low-Code Platform
As you hurtle towards digital execution, the Rapid ApplicationDevelopment platform you choose shouldn’t just be about new technologytrends, like Artificial Intelligence, Big Data, or Blockchain, orwhatever comes down the line. You need a platform that also helps youimprove operational efficiency, reduce time-to-market, and fostercollaboration between Business and IT. Something that addresses thepresent and prepares you for the future. Seek out a platform thathelps you not only deliver faster, but more accurately, so that youcan produce robust applications in a matter of weeks.

Mendix is a platform specifically built to tie all these piecestogether and enable enterprises to get things done quickly as well asallow your teams and technology ecosystem to evolve and embrace thedifferent technologies that will come along.

**High-level positioning** 

High-level positioning is about knowing how and where Mendix fits inwith the rest of your IT ecosystem. Use the Start stage to experiencethe benefits of instant provisioning, not just of the applicationenvironment, but all the software needed to support the entirelifecycle, from project management to repositories. Learning moreabout how easy it should be to deploy and operate apps shows howdevelopers can do this themselves and helps your innovation factoryachieve continuous productivity and efficiency. 

**Deployment strategy** 

The Start stage is an excellent time to start exploring your cloudoptions, and use this knowledge as input for strategic choices in thefuture. You’re most likely going to deploy your application on theMendix Cloud because it’s the most optimized cloud to run Mendix-builtapplications. Built on top of Cloud Foundry and AWS, the Mendix Cloudis the deployment solution in which Mendix provides hostingenvironments for you. It’s available globally and comes standard withdeep insights, alerting capabilities, high availability options, andbackups. 

 {{< figure src="image/path" max-width=80% class="image-border"  >}}image6.png"
style="width:6.5in;height:1.64544in" /

But as you expand your portfolio and move from Start to Structure, youwill need to consider other deployment options and moving to amulti-cloud environment. Understanding the cloud environments to whichyou’ll deploy—for example, the security features and how they fit intoyour existing security framework—will help inform how you move toStructure. 

**Data and integration strategy** 

Similar to your deployment strategy, you also want to beginconsidering what your data and integration strategy looks like withMendix as a part of your overall technology ecosystem. You need toconsider your architecture strategy, too. This is an opportunity forthat vanguard architect you elected to come in and understand whatarchitecture works best for your development program. 

## 2.3.5 Promotion: Showcasing Your Successes and How They Connect to Your Strategy
We’ve all heard the saying, “If a tree falls in the forest but no oneis around to hear it, does it make any sound?” Similarly, if you areexcellent at the core components of digital transformation but don’tcommunicate it to anyone, does it really have an impact? That is wherepromotion comes into play. Without promotion, success can gounnoticed, and the value of your efforts may not be recognized.
Promotion tends to be a challenge for many IT organizations, in partbecause IT teams do not often have professional marketers. Evenwithout a marketing team behind you, here are five ways you can betterpromote the value of low-code within your organization. 

***Shaping and communicating your low-code vision:** *We’ll help yousolidify your low-code vision later in this guide, but onceyou have it, don’t let it live on a shelf or in the cloud — allow itto evolve with input from your organization. Communicate your visionin cross-functional meetings and ask for support in gettingorganizational leadership to embed the vision into their message aswell. 

***Stakeholder management:*** Involve stakeholders early and often tobuild enthusiasm for digital transformation success. Start by bringingcross-functional partners on board who you already have strongrelationships with, and work together to identify the problems youwant to solve. By building a plan together you can help ensure yourinitiatives will get support. 

***Internal PR:*** Build a plan for how you will raise awareness andinvolvement in your low-code implementation and ensure your executivesponsor helps your PR efforts. You can leverage existing communicationchannels such as company meetings, newsletters, or sharedcollaboration sites to spread your message. Start by sharing your planand vision, and then use these channels to celebrate success afteryour first go-live.  

***Community building:*** Digital transformation is all about bringingtogether business and IT. Start with a portfolio workshop tobrainstorm ideas for your first application, and then identify teamswho will collaborate through implementation and launch. Identify acore group of champions who can raise awareness on your behalf evenwhen you aren’t in the room. 

***Celebrating success:*** We love a good reason to celebrate, andhope you’ll use milestones large and small to celebrate yoursuccesses. Acknowledging your achievements, whether it’s getting theteam to complete Academy certifications, building the first reusablecomponent, finishing the first development sprint or launching yourfirst application, celebrations are a powerful way to boost teammorale and drive future momentum.

We encourage you to take the time to develop a clear vision forlow-code development in your organization. It is critical to thesuccess of your low-code change initiative because it takes theguesswork out of people trying to understand what you want to achieve.
Low-code shouldn't (and frankly, doesn't) operate in its own universe,
so the vision should be aligned and contribute to other visions,
values, strategies, and initiatives that are already in motion in yourorganization.

There is a wide variety of ideas and opinions regarding the length,
form, structure, and scope of a vision. And your vision should reflectyour company's culture. We have compiled **a set of guidelines andrecommendations to help you in defining your vision**. Some are widelyrecognized as best practices, and others are based on our extensiveexperience. Your Mendix Transformation Manager, Digital BusinessAdvisor, or Customer Success Manager will be able to support you inthis endeavor. And if you have defined your low code vision already,
now is the perfect time to revisit it and make sure you are happy withit. 

1. **Preparation**

This step requires some analysis and time investment. Referencecompany documents and talk to your team and other key stakeholders onthe business and technology side.

It is key to ensuring alignment and contribution to other visions,
values, strategies, and initiatives that are already in place in yourorganization. We have included a list of useful questions to considerin the supporting content for the preparation task (you can find thisin the resources, at the top of this page).

2. **First iteration: Mind map / brainstorm**

Start exploring the areas that you want to transform. We recommendthinking along the lines of the 5 P’s – People, Process, Platform,
Portfolio, Promotion – because these cover all the aspects you needwhen undergoing a transformation. This also ties well into other toolswe use such as the Maturity Assessment, which is also groupedaccording to the 5 P’s.

Imagine how you want those areas to look like in 3-4 years. Thattimeframe is the perfect balance between realistic and achievable andit gives you the chance to work on different aspects simultaneously.
More than that and it's too far in the future, too fuzzy, you can'tknow what the world will look like in 10 years. Too short and there'snot enough time to do something impactful – it won't be inspirational.
Add key words to a mind map for each of the five areas.

3. **Second iteration: Prioritize and add details**

Select the most important ideas and create full sentences as bulletpoints, adding details so that anyone reading the sentence canunderstand what it means.

You can also start adding key results or placeholders for them, suchas, "Achieve an ROI of \[amount\] by \[date\]".

4. **Third iteration: Evaluate and refine**

Review and refine your bullet points. You need to ensure that you canevaluate whether a particular point has been completed or achieved.
Finish adding relevant key results or placeholders. You may choose toleave the actual numbers in the key results blank and ask your teamsor key people in your organization to set the ambition levelsthemselves. This creates ownership and buy-in to your vision.

Once you have full sentences for all bullet points and the relevantkey results, you need to review them all, asking "Is this ambitiousenough or is it too ambitious?"

The objectives need to be achievable, but it also shouldn't be tooeasy. You need to find that balance. But don't overthink it – you willprobably need to adjust some key results along the way, and that's OK.
More about that in the "Use your vision to steer your journey"
objective.

5. **Socialize your vision and gather feedback**

Show your draft vision to key stakeholders and a selection ofemployees to get their feedback. When others read your vision, theyneed to experience a moment of awe and wonder. If their jaws don’tdrop a little bit, you need to think bigger. Small, safe, calculatedplans don’t inspire – a vision needs a wow factor. And don't be putoff if there’s a small number – around 10%-15% or so – who don't likeit.

What you don't want is indifference.

Check during this refining stage that people understand the vision –
and that it accurately represents what you want to achieve and whatyour organization needs.

**6. Write your final version**

In this final stage, you need to consider what feedback is relevantand what you want to incorporate.

If you think it would be more efficient, you might want to get supportfrom a writer to polish some of those sentences so they pop off thepage and resonate with your team and stakeholders. However, balancethe effort you invest – done is better than perfect!

**Communicate your vision effectively **

Once you have your vision, you need to communicate it effectively toyour team. You need to make sure that everyone understands it so thatthey are motivated to work towards it. 

People should understand the significance of what they are doing. Theyshould feel connected to something larger than themselves. That givestheir work meaning and shows their value in the organization. Thatsense of meaning and purpose is one of the most fulfilling outcomes ofa vision.

You may choose to have town halls or an all-hands to present it inperson. Others have made videos that can be shown asynchronously, andthat people can come back to for reference and for onboarding. Onlyrelying on the written word such as email is usually not dynamic orinspiring enough for this type of communication. Be brave to trysomething new, but choose a tone and method that feels authentic, too.

## Lecture 3.2 Build Your Getting Started Plan
As the primary person responsible for the implementation of Mendixwithin your organization, it’s critical to have a plan for gettingstarted. So far, we’ve introduced the 5 P’s, and now it’s time tothink about how each of these relates to your own organization’ssuccess. Having a plan for getting started helps to build alignmentand buy-in among your business and IT stakeholders. Your low-codevision, as discussed in the previous section, is critically importantto this plan.

First, work with stakeholders to align your start stage goals and keychallenges. These goals should be focused on what success looks likefor your team and how to measure it. Goals could be something like “Atthe end of Q3, we will have at least two apps live” or “We want togenerate X-amount of ROI with our first application”. The start stageis all about bringing together your first team, building, deploying,
and celebrating your first apps while defining a future portfoliovision. Keep your start-stage goals related to these topics, butcustomize them based on what you want to achieve. You should consideryour low-code vision as the future state you are working toward, thenbreak those into digestible goals for your getting started plan.

After you’ve established your goals, think about the challenges thatmight get in your way and then build a mitigation plan to avoid those.
Is your team new to working in Agile? Adopting a new way of workingmight be one of your challenges, and the getting started plan willneed to focus on how to bring your team up to speed. Think through anyfactors that might hinder your progress and work with stakeholders onhow you’ll tackle them together.

Now that you have your goals and challenges identified, considermilestones for each of the 5 P’s as part of your getting started plan.
Here are some ideas:

* Portfolio
* First app identified
* App value definition completed
* First app live
* Portfolio defined
* People
* First team trained
* Training and enablement plan defined
* Team growth strategy defined
* Process
* Governance strategy defined
* Mendix support introduced
* Stage retrospective executed
* Platform
* Deployment strategy defined
* Data and integration strategy defined
* Architecture strategy defined
* Promotion
* Host a go-live celebration for first application
* Gather relevant stakeholders to show progress
* Share the success at company meeting or in newsletters
The final step of your getting started plan involves capturing your 5
P milestones and building a timeline. Below are some examples that weuse frequently with Mendix customers that you can take and make yourown: Add details, and overlay dates appropriate for your organization,
etc. Work independently or work with your customer success manager tothink through what this might look like for you.

## Lecture 3.3 Start Your Mendix Portfolio
Now let’s focus on developing your portfolio. Portfolio Management isa top-down process led by a portfolio manager and decision-makers. Itsmain purpose is to assess potential initiatives and ensure they alignwith business goals. Initiatives that don't meet the criteria areexcluded from consideration.

To make sure that the strategy is reflected in the initiatives, you needto put into place a program to ensure vision alignment at every level,
across every department. At this level, program owners or managersempower collaboration across departments. This will ensure that everysolution will always meet the criteria and support the goals of thevision. It’s about trying to create software that delivers immediatevalue, which requires input from and collaboration with many peopleacross your organization.

Portfolio Management starts at the company level, where strategy isdefined. The company strategy leads to a Portfolio Vision, which istranslated into a backlog and budget for all initiatives. 

 {{< figure src="image/path" max-width=80% class="image-border"  >}}image9.png"
style="width:6.5in;height:3.45677in" /

To start, think about the big picture: What is your organizationstriving to achieve? Jot down a few ideas that can help you get there.
These could include solutions to migrate from legacy apps, improvecustomer experience or increase efficiency. And Mendix has a tool tohelp you do just that!

You should have already created your portfolio in lecture 2.5, if youhaven’t yet let’s start by creating your Portfolio board, you can dothat by going [here](https://portfolio.mendix.com/), clickingOpen Portfolio Management and then click **Create Portfolio.**You canmake it restricted for the time being (that means you will have toapprove other people before they gain access to it).  

If you have done a portfolio workshop already and maybe have your listof initiatives in an Excel file, you can easily import them. If not,
just create a few cards that represent your ideas. Your Mendix teamcan also help you with this, so please do not hesitate to reach out tothem to go over everything together.

Portfolio management is a key activity that ensures you are alwayscreating solutions that bring the most value to your organization (andsince we’re talking Mendix here, this is where you also decide ifMendix is the right tool for each one of the ideas). This means thatyou (maybe together with your stakeholders) need to go over your mainportfolio, keep initiatives up to date and adjust or reprioritize ifneeded. You can learn a lot more about this process in the dedicatedguide . For now, the most important thing is to list theinitiatives that are top of mind for you and use that input to choosethe ideal first app. 

So, let’s add your initiatives. Click the *Create Initiative* buttonon the top right and start jotting down your ideas.

## Lecture 3.4 Finalize First Application Selection 

It’s important that your first applications bring immediate value uponlaunch, because rapid application development isn’t just aboutdelivering rapidly, it’s about realizing value quicker than you havebefore. 

We recommend that you start with adding at least three applicationsideas to your portfolio. While the first success is always important,
to truly grasp the new rapid application development process and theMendix platform, developing multiple apps and demonstrating repeatedsuccess is a best practice. 

As for your very first project, you want to pick a use case out ofyour portfolio that is equal parts meaningful and doable. A greatfirst project is something that impacts the enterprise positively butcan be completed by a relatively small team in a reasonabletimeframe. 

Here’s a **quick checklist of things to consider when choosing yourfirst application**:

**Go live quickly:** One of the main goals of your first applicationis to validate your ability to rapidly bring new ideas to market. It’simportant that you identify quick wins, so select applications thatare limited in scope and can stand alone in production. 

**Make them worthy:** The first application should also be highlyvisible within the organization. It must have the right urgency andexecutive support, and also deliver tangible business value. Select anapp idea where you’re sure the results will get noticed and thesuccess will be shared by your stakeholders. 

**Involve business stakeholders:** Requirements are often unclear andneed to be refined through collaboration with, and feedback from,
business stakeholders. The goal is to illustrate the higher level ofcreativity and collaboration facilitated by this new rapid applicationdevelopment approach.   The key to involving business stakeholderslies with the role of the product owner. The product owner knows whatneeds to be built. Application success is achieved when thedevelopment team and product owner work together with a passion formaking applications that deliver value. 

**Limit dependencies:** External factors over which you have little,
or no control can quickly diminish the productivity advantage offeredby the Mendix platform. That’s like using a permanent marker on abrand-new whiteboard. 

**Don’t get bogged down in requirements:** Digital innovation projectsare often marked by unclear business requirements. Don’t worry; thisis a good thing, because it is better to define a high-level goal orpurpose versus having detailed requirements. The more requirementsyour first applications have upfront, the longer it’s going to take torelease. Make sure that you have at least two follow-up iterationsplanned so that you can capture and refine requirements and buildtrust with the business stakeholders. This shows them that even iftheir requirements don’t make it into the initial MVP, they will comein the next versions. 

**Make failures into wins:** It’s ok to admit defeat. In this case,
it’s actually beneficial. It may sound contradictory, but good firstapplications are often ones that your organization previously failedto deliver.

For instance, a Mendix customer initially failed to build anapplication that calculates prices because the algorithm was sospecific to the business, and the .NET developer couldn’t grasp allthe nuances. Using Mendix, business stakeholders and IT developerswere able to take that failure and turn it into a win, collaboratemuch more closely, and successfully deliver a first version of theapplication in a few days. 

**Make them smart:** To ensure that apps deliver the best possibleexperience to the user, they should be intelligent, contextual andproactive — i.e., smart. Develop an app that uses AI to personalize auser’s experience or uses geolocation to tell let you know thelocation for the cake you ordered for your big app launch party. 

**The complexity matrix:**

Using the complexity matrix is a great way to assess the rightprojects for your Start stage portfolio. 

**Exposure** is the amount of usage or availability an applicationhas. **Complexity** can be defined as how technically complex theapplication is; i.e., how many integrations does the applicationrequire? You want to start on the left-hand side of the quadrant,
which represents your team learning and feeling comfortable with thenew way of working.

**Which type of projects is Mendix a good fit for? **

Another thing that might help is understanding which type of projectsMendix is the best fit for (and which ones are not a great fit).
Here’s a little guide for that.

**Mendix fits a wide variety of software applications, but some reallystand out as a perfect fit: **

* Any software requirement where there is no off-the-shelf solutionavailable 

* Software projects when the requirements are not very clear yet andthe business also requires flexibility during the developmentprocess 

* Software projects where there is going to be a high degree ofbusiness involvement during the development process 

* Situations where the customer wants to build multiple applicationsand they want to benefit from reusing components 

* Applications that require multichannel (desktop/mobile/tablet etc.) 

* Workflow applications 

* Customer-facing applications that need to be pixel perfect 

* Flexible applications: applications that start small but need to beable to scale up 

* Applications that require governance, since things like audit andtraceability are built in the platform 

* Projects where resources are scarce, since Mendix is easy to learndevelopers can be trained internally and citizen developers can beused 

* Applications that the customer wants to maintain and supportthemselves 

* Projects where changes after go-live are likely to happen 

* Internal work portals 

* Process-oriented applications 

* Integrations applications 

* Applications that require data-management 

* Applications that replace Excel applications 

* Applications that have integrations with other platforms and systems(like SAP) 

* Projects that are going to replace a legacy application 

* Any new solutions where the data is also going to be stored in theapplication 

* Extensions of System of Record (ERP/PLM/MES etc.) 

**Which type of projects would Mendix potentially not be the perfectfit for? **

Even though you can build almost anything with Mendix, especially withthe extensibility of the platform using Java, Mendix might not be theperfect fit for every application. Below are some examples ofapplications where additional work needs to be done. 

* Games (as Mendix is aimed to build business applications) 

* Content Management Systems, but Mendix can integrate well withexisting CMS for creating CMS portals and such 

* Data warehouse applications, similar to CMS, Mendix can integratewell with existing data warehouse applications 

* Enterprise Service Bus applications. When the main purpose is toconnect applications with other applications, without addingbusiness value/logic, Mendix might not be the best fit 

* Applications with heavy mathematical calculations, but Mendix wouldbe a good layer on top of an AI solution or calculation engine thatcompute statistical models or data analytics 

* Web portals with more than 10,000 concurrent users 

* Mobile applications with more than 100,000 concurrent users 

* Applications where the main goal is to visualize data 

## Lecture 3.5 Define Application Value
<span class="mark"\[Lecture Resource Value Template for CustomersPPT)</span

By thoroughly defining the application’s purpose and value, youprovide a clear roadmap for development, aligning the project withorganizational goals, and setting the stage for successfulimplementation and adoption. What will help you do that is trying tothink along these lines:

1.  **Business value proposition:**

* Clearly articulate the value proposition of the application. Askyourself: What problem does this application solve? Whatspecific business process or pain point does it address? Howdoes it contribute to the organization's success? What benefitswill it bring to the business, such as cost savings, revenuegeneration, or improved customer satisfaction?

2.  **User experience and satisfaction:**

* Identify the target audience or users who will benefit from theapplication. Understanding the end-users helps in tailoring theapplication to their needs.

* Consider the user experience as a critical aspect of theapplication's value. An intuitive and user-friendly interfaceenhances user satisfaction and adoption.

* Value is often derived not just from functionalities but alsofrom how easily and effectively users can accomplish theirtasks.

3.  **Efficiency and productivity:**

* Assess how the application improves operational efficiency andproductivity. Identify areas where manual processes can beautomated, reducing errors and saving time.

* Highlight any potential cost savings or resource optimizationachieved through the application.

4.  **Innovation and competitive advantage:**

* If applicable, emphasize how the application introducesinnovative solutions or features that set your organizationapart from competitors.

* Consider how the application positions the organization forfuture growth and adaptation to changing market conditions.

5.  **Adaptability and scalability:**

* Highlight the application's adaptability to changing businessneeds and its scalability to accommodate future growth. Avaluable application is one that can evolve with theorganization.

6.  **Measurable objectives:**

* Establish measurable objectives to gauge the success of theapplication. Define key performance indicators (KPIs) that willhelp evaluate its impact on business processes, efficiency, orother relevant metrics.

* Measurable objectives provide a basis for assessing theapplication's effectiveness and return on investment.

7.  **Alignment with organizational goals:**

* Confirm that the application purpose aligns with the overallgoals and vision of the organization. It should contributepositively to the strategic direction of the company.

* Understand how the application fits into the larger ecosystem oforganizational processes and systems.

You can also try filling in a template such as this one (you can findthis template attached in the Resources box at the top of this page):

## Lecture 3.6  Set up Deployment Architecture and Resources
Mendix applications can be deployed in different ways, mainly:

1.  Public
2.  Private
3.  On-premise
**Mendix Public Cloud** is the default deployment option and has theadvantage of being a fully integrated solution, with easy setting upand administrating. When developing your first application and ifthere are no specific (private) cloud constraints, it makes sense tochoose the user friendly Mendix Cloud option. Within Mendix Cloud,
there are options for multi-tenant cloud environments andsingle-tenant cloud environments. Deploying to Mendix Cloud gives youthe shortest time-to-value.

Mendix can also be deployed to any cloud platform which supports aversion of Cloud Foundry. With **Mendix for Private Cloud**, you canchoose the cloud provider of your preference, e.g. your own Azure orAWS infrastructures. If there already is access to an on-premisehosting environment, Mendix can also be deployed on-premise.

When setting up your deployment strategy, it is important to look atthe features that are needed, as some features that rely on the targetplatform can work differently.

If your organization is deploying on **Private Cloud or on-prem**,
please **make sure that you are ready to take on the effort andresponsibility of managing all hosting and support of the applicationdeployments**.

For a list of all the deployment options that are available, see:
[/developerportal/deploy/](/developerportal/deploy/). 

Some highlights to consider:

**Mendix Public Cloud:**

* Pros: Fast and easy, all hosting is taken care of.  It has the bestutilization rate for your infrastructure allowing you to maintainoptimal flexibility and convert your capital investment intooperational expenses. This option is supported by Mendix and it isthe most optimized cloud to run Mendix applications.

* Cons: Some organizations don’t allow shared cloud usage and requireair-gapped or private-cloud options
**Mendix Private Cloud:**

* Pros: Your DevOps team has complete control over applicationdeployment and application lifecycle, with centralizedmanagement. It is cloud agnostic, and you can choose on-premise oryour chosen cloud provider.

* Cons: Requires your own experienced staff to set up and maintainwith reduced Mendix Support due to lack of access and visibility.

For Private deployment , **please be ready to start that processimmediately in order to avoid development and go-live date delays**. 

See below for Private Cloud responsibility matrix:

 {{< figure src="image/path" max-width=80% class="image-border"  >}}image13.png"
style="width:6.5in;height:2.69648in" /

## Lecture 3.7 Review Options for Development Resources (Who Will Build Your First App?)

With Mendix, you have multiple options to choose from for thedevelopment of your applications:

1.  **In-house development**

1.  Train and/or hire Mendix developers to develop and support allyour Mendix applications.

When training in-house, we recommend choosing individuals who eitherhave a traditional development background or have some understandingof OOP (object-oriented programming).  We’ve also seen individualswithout a technical background succeed if they have the rightproblem-solving mindset!  Beyond the technical side, you also want tolook for individuals who can provide consulting to your businessteam. Mendix development is quick and Agile, and you need someone whocan speak to not only the technical side of Mendix but also thebusiness side at the same time in order to prevent projectbottlenecks.

1.  **Mendix partner**

1.  Bring in one of our certified Mendix partners to support yourapp development.  Our directory of partners is listed[here](https://developerprofiles.mendix.com/link/partneroverview),
but your Mendix team is a great resource to identify a good fitfor you.

This can be a great option to get your project kick-started, or if youhave no future goals of building out your internal development team.

1.  **Mendix Expert Services**

1.  Our team of experts are here to support you! We have manyoptions for enabling your team and helping you quicklydemonstrate the power of Mendix.

Choosing Expert Services is the right option if you plan on buildingout your internal team and need enablement and support alongsideapplication development.  Expert Services can help prove the value ofthe Mendix internally while simultaneously coaching your team on howto continue with the application(s).

1.  **Hybrid**

1.  You can simultaneously grow your in-house team and supplementwith a Mendix partner and/or our Expert Services team
Regardless of which option you choose, we always recommend that atleast one person internally has been trained on Mendix and istechnically capable of directing the project.  Outsourcing everytechnical role creates a siloed development team that does not trulyunderstand your business needs.

## Lecture 4.1 Introduction to Agile
**What is the Agile Framework?**

Defining and honing your development process is a critical factor inprogram success. By nature of low-code, **the [AgileFramework](https://www.mendix.com/agile-framework/) is the best way towork with Mendix.**

Understanding how to work in Agile allows organizations to [stayresponsive tochange](https://s2.bl-1.com/h/i/dtfq477y/xKsSFL1?url=https://www.mendix.com/blog/design-thinking-vs-agile-combine-problem-finding-problem-solving-better-outcomes/)
and reduce time-to-market by nearly 50%. Mendix highlights thesebenefits by providing capabilities such as sprints, story management,
and integrated feedback management within the platform itself.

In the Academy, you can find an [Agile Awareness learningpath](https://academy.mendix.com/link/paths/110/Agile-Awareness)
that you can use to train your team in the Agile Framework and how itwill define your Mendix journey. 

## Lecture 4.2 Identify Your First Mendix Project Team
This section addresses how you set up your first Mendix Project Team.
Ensuring you have the right people in the right roles is a criticalstep in successfully getting started. Everyone participating should beinterested and enthusiastic about learning how to leverage thispowerful platform, how to constantly improve collaboration and bestpractices across roles and groups within the BizDevOps model, and howthe work they’ll be doing will bring value to the end users and theoverall organization.

**Setting up your Agile Scrum team**

To work in Mendix, we recommend working in an Agile Scrum Team that isalready familiar with the Agile Framework (if needed, refer to this[Agile Awareness LearningPath)](https://academy.mendix.com/link/paths/110/Agile-Awareness).
This framework allows development teams to collaborate better, respondto change, and continuously incorporate user feedback.

It’s important to have small cross-functional teams to make sure thatknowledge of all aspects is available within the team with all rolesbeing covered. If needed, a person can take on multiple roles as longas they have the skills, expertise, and time to commit to each role.
Ideal Scrum Teams are composed of 5-7 people, never exceeding nine forlarger enterprises. 

Getting all the required knowledge in each team might be difficultwhile keeping your team small, efficient, and aligned. Mendixconsiders a Scrum team as a juncture of a **core team** and**accelerators**. 

**Core Team:**

* **Product Owner (PO):** responsible for defining the direction of aproject. They have a clear understanding of what the business andusers need from the product being developed and the value to bedelivered. They translate these needs to the Scrum team. The PO:

* Is a liaison between the business and the development team tobuild, prioritize, and manage the backlog to drive productionforward.

* Ensures the product being developed delivers the required valuefor the business and users. 

* Accepts or rejects the completed work
Ideal POs have these five key [skills &
characteristics.](https://www.mendix.com/blog/5-important-product-owner-skills-for-rapid-app-dev/)

* **Scrum Master (SM):** ensures that the team follows Agile bestpractices and ioversees addressing and removing any productivityblockers that may come up. Essentially, the Scrum master is theauthority in Agile and Scrum to keep the team working togetherefficiently and effectively. SMs:

* Should be supportive leaders. 

* Help POs define the product’s value, plan work, and manage thebacklog. 

* Help developers self-organize.

* **Development Team:** consists of the people who actually build theapp. They are responsible for turning the requirements intofunctionality, based on the input provided by the Product Owner. Thedevelopment team:

* Is comprised of one or more people with the skills needed tobuild the product as envisioned by the PO.

* May be comprised of non-developers and traditional developersalike: architects, writers, technical BAs, designers, and otherspecialized roles can all be part of the development team. 

* Work with the SM in the key Scrum activities of sprint planning,
sprint review, retrospectives and daily standups to keep theirassigned tasks on track with high-quality code during eachsprint, while working towards continuous improvement as a team.

**Accelerators:**

* **BAs or SMEs** get involved when a team requires detailed knowledgeabout such subjects as UX/UI, QA, testing and integration. 

* **The Business Owner** is the primary stakeholder who is ultimatelyresponsible and accountable for the end-result of the project andproduct including the actual value delivered. 

* **Stakeholders** are the end-users of the product under development,
represent strategical, tactical, and operational levels of thebusiness. 

Your team does not have to fit this exact mold, but it is importantthat all the responsibilities outlined here are covered to ensuresuccess in your low-code program. Here’s a typical team structure:

## Lecture 4.3 Arrange Academy Training for Your Team
As you begin to map out your Mendix team, it's important to establisha training plan. Properly training your Mendix team helps accelerateyour time to first value and promotes long-term low-code success. Ithelps each team member take charge of their own success and theoverall team’s success.

Take the time to familiarize yourself with the [MendixAcademy](https://academy.mendix.com/link/home). Here, we provide avariety of guides and individual courses for various roles anddiverse backgrounds to allow you to customize the learning journeyappropriate for each team member and role. Once you are familiar withthe various guides, diverse topics and individual courses,
create a training plan with each team member based on their role andexperience. 

Here is a sample you can use as a template:

 {{< figure src="image/path" max-width=80% class="image-border"  >}}image15.png"
style="width:6.5in;height:3.6519in" /

This will vary based on the specific people taking each role. A ScrumMaster who used to be a full-stack developer could take the *CrashCourse* instead of the *Become a Rapid Developer* course. Your EA mayneed to add *Native Mobile* or *Configure Advanced Security* for yourparticular organization, project and team needs. Your Mendix team ishappy to help create your training plan.

**Mendix Certificates **

Mendix provides four different certification levels to measuredeveloper maturity, each with an increasing level of required skilland experience:

 {{< figure src="image/path" max-width=80% class="image-border"  >}}image16.png"
style="width:6.5in;height:1.44219in" /

**Rapid Developer Certification**

A Rapid Developer has a baseline knowledge of the Mendix platform andknows where to find information using the documentation and forum.
This certification is proof of basic Mendix knowledge and demonstratesthat someone can join a project team and independently buildprototypes.

The Rapid Developer certification is a minimum requirement for workingin Mendix. Before taking a certification exam, there is requiredcoursework for each level. All courses can either be taken via[[instructor-led](https://academy.mendix.com/link/classrooms)](https://academy.mendix.com/link/classrooms)
or via a
[[self-led](https://academy.mendix.com/link/paths)](https://academy.mendix.com/link/paths)
. 

You can find all the details about the certification, as well as therequired coursework[here](https://academy.mendix.com/link/certifications/23/rapid). 

As your team grows and takes on more projects, it's important tocontinue to also level up on your Mendix expertise. Proper enablementwill allow your team to take on more complex projects and deliver morebusiness impact. When able, remember to take the time to level up onyour Mendix Certification.

**Intermediate Developer Certification **

An Intermediate Developer has the fundamental knowledge of the Mendixplatform to start building the next great apps. This certification isproof that someone is ready to be added to operating teams and cancontribute from the start by applying your knowledge and skills indifferent parts of the project development lifecycle.

## Lecture 4.4 Organize Your Program Kick-Off
The program kick-off is important to hold before the project kick-offas this meeting ensures alignment across all groups and team membersinvolved, from leadership to the development team, on goals, vision,
and value.  This meeting sets the foundation for bridging business andIT as you begin your Mendix journey.

**Who should be there?**

Make sure to include the relevant business and IT leaders, projectteam members, other stakeholders, Mendix and/or Mendix partner teammembers. If your executive sponsor could also be there, that would beamazing.

**What’s the agenda?**

A sample agenda of a successful program kickoff can include:

* A round of introductions
* Why Mendix was chosen
* Business and IT alignment on:

* Organizational challenges and needs Mendix is solving (this iswhere your low-code vision will be very important — you alwaysneed to be able to tie Mendix work back to the larger businessneeds)

* An overview of Mendix vision and strategy for your organization
* Goals and success at both the organizational and projectlevels
* Important milestones 

* Value measurement and impact
* Identify initial concerns or challenges and build mitigationplans(s)

* Establish a cadence for this group to meet going forward for abusiness review - quarterly, every other month, monthly, etc.

## 4.5 Summary
Amazing, you should have kicked-off your Mendix Program by now! Duringthis phase you:

* Made sure the right Expert Leads and Stakeholders needed for yourMendix program are involved.

* Familiarized with the agile framework and its benefits, and decidedwhether or not to use this way of working.

* Built your first Mendix project team and arranged Academy trainingbased on their role and needs.

* Planned a successful program kick-off.

You are now ready to move to the next phase. Good job! 

# Module 5: Governance and Control in Mendix
## Module introduction (module tile): 

In this module, you will get a quick view on the features we offer toincorporate governance in your process. We will show you in detailwhich of these you need to configure at the start, so the platformsupports your organisation’s onboarding.

## Learning Objectives
Now that you have kicked-off your Mendix Program, it’s time tofamiliarize with the features Mendix offers to incorporate governance inyour process.

By the end of this module, you will be able to:

* Recognize the options Mendix offers to tailor the platform to yourspecific governance needs
* Identify the required steps to Configure the Platform in ControlCenter
## Lecture 5.1 Introduction to Governance in Mendix
Low-code governance is about having oversight and maintaining controlover both a landscape of apps and individual app development. Itprovides guardrails for your development process  
and brings resources together to achieve the enterprise’s objectives.
Increase accountability,  
increase transparency, and get the most ROI out of what your teamsbuild and deploy.  
It will help you maximize business value at acceptable risk and cost.
Knowing the broad strokes capabilities of the Mendix platform early onhelps in getting solid early successes.

When you start, the governance responsibility will probably be in thehands of your Mendix admin, but as your Mendix landscape grows you maywant to define a Center of Excellence. Admins can use Control Center,
a dashboard that gives you an overview of various company activitieson the Mendix platform, to manage many of the aspects of landscapegovernance.  
 {{< figure src="image/path" max-width=80% class="image-border"  >}}image17.png"
style="width:6.25in;height:3.33333in" /

There are several advanced capabilities in the Control Center to helpyou manage your app landscape as it grows.

* [Dashboard](/control-center/dashboard/)
provides insight into some KPIs of how your company is advancing.

* [Apps](/control-center/apps/) provides easyvisibility into all apps, environments, their deployment status,
technical contact, version, and more.

* [Healthdashboard](/control-center/application-health-dashboard/)
provides an insight into the running status of your app landscape.

* [Entitlements](/control-center/entitlements/)
shows the resources you’ve bought and used.

* You can add, resize or remove environments in the [Deployedapps](/control-center/deployed-apps/) view.

* Additional curation settings are available for[Marketplace](/control-center/private-marketplace/),
[Portfolios](/control-center/portfolios/),
and [DataCatalog](/control-center/catalog-admin/),
which apply to all your developers.

New capabilities are released regularly, so exploring Control Centerregularly is always a good idea!

But as you can tell from the slide below, governance touches manyaspects of the development cycle and it’s not just confined to controlcenter.

 {{< figure src="image/path" max-width=80% class="image-border"  >}}image18.png"
style="width:6.36055in;height:3.28628in" /

If you would like to learn more about our governance features, you cancheck out the [Control CenterGuide,](/control-center/) [Control centerlearningpath](https://academy.mendix.com/link/paths/116/Govern-and-Scale-your-App-Landscape-with-Mendix-Control-Center),
or the Mendix documentation. You probably already involved your subjectmatter experts while you were evaluating Mendix, so they might want todo a deeper dive.

A lot of these options will become more relevant for you as you scaleyour Mendix portfolio, so for now, we will just point to a couple of keysettings that are important for getting started and launching your firstapp.

## Lecture 5.2 Configure the Platform in Control Center
The Mendix platform has a few options to tailor the platform to yourspecific governance needs. 

**Claim additional email domains ** {{< figure src="image/path" max-width=80% class="image-border"  >}}image19.png"
style="width:0.22222in;height:0.22222in" alt="direct hit" / 
 {{< figure src="image/path" max-width=80% class="image-border"  >}}image20.png"
style="width:5in;height:2.19792in" /

If your company has more than one email domain, all your email domainsshould be claimed, such as: MyCompany.com, MyCompany.nl,
MyCompany-SpecialUnit.com etc. This is to ensure all users that do asignup with an email address on any of these domains all end-up in thesame ‘company’ on the Mendix platform. If you don’t do this from thestart, your users may create projects in different ‘companies’/tenantson the Mendix platform, which is hard to govern and may requirecumbersome merging activities later.

[You can read more about that,
here.](/control-center/company-settings/#company-email-domains)

**Assign a security contact**  
 {{< figure src="image/path" max-width=80% class="image-border"  >}}image21.png"
style="width:3.50864in;height:1.47929in" / 
Provide a specific **Security Contact** who is informed if there arecritical security issues with the Mendix platform andplatform-supported Marketplace components. Mendix strongly recommendsapplying a team email address or a functional mailbox instead of apersonal individual email address.

Your security contact person(s) may want to subscribe the [MendixSecurityAdvisories](/releasenotes/security-advisories/)
to get familiar with the process around security fixes.

[Additionalreading](/control-center/company-settings/#security-contact)

**Define company brand and description**
 {{< figure src="image/path" max-width=80% class="image-border"  >}}image19.png"
style="width:0.22222in;height:0.22222in" alt="direct hit" / 
 {{< figure src="image/path" max-width=80% class="image-border"  >}}image22.png"
style="width:5in;height:3.63542in" / 
On the **Company Brand** page, you can upload, edit, or remove a**Company Logo**. The company logo uploaded here will appear acrossthe platform where it is used. For instance, it will be displayed onyour published Marketplace content.

[Additionalreading](/control-center/company-brand/)

**Setup IDP or SSO for access to the Mendix platform**
 {{< figure src="image/path" max-width=80% class="image-border"  >}}image23.png"
style="width:0.22222in;height:0.22222in" alt="direct hit" /

It is recommended that you [set-upSSO](/control-center/security/set-up-sso-byoidp/)
between the Mendix platform and your corporate IDP such as MicrosoftEntra ID (f.k.a. Azure AD) or Okta.  This will put your IDP in controlof how users are authenticated before they can access your content onthe Mendix platform. Leavers (former employees) will not be able tologin. Your platform users get the convenience of Single Sign-On,
rather than yet-another-password. See also our [BYOIDPblog](https://www.mendix.com/blog/introducing-byoidp-bring-your-own-identity-provider/).

Optionally, you may set up access rules in your IDP to control whichof your employees can and cannot work on the Mendix platform. As weencourage collaboration in multi-disciplined teams, be careful not tobe too restrictive or not apply any restriction at all. For example,
potential end-users of Mendix apps may want to contribute todevelopment teams. In a later stage you can set up restrictive accessrules as you start putting more business-critical IPs in the logic ofyour Mendix apps.

### Setup password policy
If you don’t enable SSO, you will want to specify if the userpasswords expire or not. If you do not want the passwords to expire,
toggle **Passwords of company members never expire** to **On**.  
##  Lecture 5.3 Summary
Now that you know how Mendix can be tailored to your own governanceneeds, you are ready to get your first project started! You will findall the useful information to do this in the following module.

# Module 6: Get Started With Your First Project
## Module introduction (module tile): 

In this module, you will get all the information you need to know tohelp you get started with your first Mendix project.

## Learning Objectives
It’s now time to begin your first Mendix project! How exciting!

By the end of this module, you will be able to: 

* Organize your first project kick-off
* Create your project
* Ensure project access for all of your team members
* Set up the agile way of working
* Define requirements for your first project 

* Identify continuous collaboration that you can leverage throughMendix
## Lecture 6.1 Organize Your First Project Kick-off
Now that the program is properly kicked off, the next step is toorganize the kick-off for your first project. Kick-off meetings are agreat way to communicate key project information to your team and givethem an opportunity to ask questions. You might also want to have yourkey stakeholders in the same (physical or virtual) room. 

A sample agenda for a successful project kickoff might include:

* Introduction: Make sure everyone knows each other.

* The background of the project i.e. why are you doing it in the firstplace? (Go back to your application value definition and simplypresent the most important points to your team).

* What is the project scope: You might not have your MVP scope definedin the kick-off meeting and that’s ok. What is important is to havea clear understanding of the problem you are solving and what themost crucial aspect of that problem to tackle first.

* Who’s doing what: Here every team member should have a clearunderstanding of their roles and responsibilities (in the context ofthe scrum framework as well as in general).

* How are you going to work together: Establish your agile rituals(standups, refinements, reviews, retrospectives) and decide whoshould be attending and how often. In general, all team members willbe coming to all the rituals, but your stakeholders will not. Theonly thing that is super important for your stakeholders to attendis the sprint review.

* What does success look like: How will you know if you have deliveredvalue? These could be project milestones, but also metrics you wouldlike to influence.

## Lecture 6.2 Create Your Project and Make Sure Everyone Has Access
Anyone can sign up to the Mendix platform using their business emailaddress, so there is no need to on-board a specific list of users. Allthey need to do is go to[signup.mendix.com](http://signup.mendix.com) and use therelevant company email domain (any from the list you have added inlecture 5.2). 

If you are working with implementation partners, you need to decide**how to give those team members access to your app projects**.

You may take one of the following approaches:

* One possibility is to invite external users to your app projectsusing their external email address (e.g. Joan@MyMendixPartner.com).

* Another possibility is to create accounts for them in your company’sEntra ID (or similar IdP such as Okta).

**Create your first app!**

And now that everyone has a Mendix account, this is the moment you’veall been waiting for — it’s time to actually create your first app!
Anyone from your team can click the Create App button on the Mendixplatform, just make sure they are logged in with an email address fromyour company domain.

 {{< figure src="image/path" max-width=80% class="image-border"  >}}image24.png"
style="width:6.5in;height:3.16367in" /

Once the project is created, everyone from the team should get accessto it as well as their appropriate role. This is the overview of thedefault project roles on the Mendix platform: 

 {{< figure src="image/path" max-width=80% class="image-border"  >}}image25.png"
style="width:6.5in;height:3.02148in" /

## Lecture 6.3 Setting up the Agile Way of Working
Sprint Zero is all about laying the groundwork for a successfulproject by focusing on planning and preparation rather thanimmediately jumping into development. It might seem like this is awhole lot of process while the team is ready to get to building, butespecially for your first project, it is crucial to set up the rightprocess, get everyone comfortable with it and define the initialrequirements — this will absolutely speed you up very soon. 

Let’s start by setting up your agile ways of working. You might havedefined some things already in your project kick-off, so you can startby revisiting that. Moving forward, you also need to determine whichAgile practices will become your organizational standard: this couldbe Scrum (the Mendix platform is optimized for Scrum at team level),
Kanban, or other variants. Creating a standard doesn't mean that allteams will be forced to work in exactly the same way, but having ashared set of practices will increase mobility between teams. The morefamiliar and standardized this methodology is across yourorganization, the tighter the collaboration will be amongst teams asteam members understand expectations and roles. 

However, it should be noted that your agile methodology should remainlightweight and flexible to keep administrative burden as low aspossible while maximizing the benefits to your organization. The wayof working should suit the team's needs, so that they can get the bestout of themselves. Take a pragmatic approach so that this can bediscovered progressively. 

Regardless of Agile methodology, some of the practices that you canconsider standardizing are: 

* Sprint 0 (or design sprints) 

* Daily stand-ups
* Sprint planning
* Backlog refinement
* Product demos
* Team retrospectives
Care should be taken to incorporate feedback from team retrospectivesand other Agile ceremonies into your standards as part of yourcontinuous improvement process. That includes reviewing and analyzingany shortcuts taken or other deviations from the standard process tounderstand why it was necessary and potentially consider adapting yourstandards or putting another appropriate measure in place.

Development teams can work most efficiently if requirements areclearly described (e.g. in user stories), to estimate the effort andimplementation. Because of this, it is important that you choose atool in which these can be tracked. The Mendix platform offers acollaborative tool called[Epics](https://www.mendix.com/blog/mendix-projects-and-the-wizardry-of-epics/),
in which this is possible. Here you can manage the backlog, epics,
create user stories, and of course sprints. Both the Agile and Kanbanmethods are supported.

An organization that is familiar with the Agile way of working willlikely already use related tools, such as JIRA. JIRA is often used forScrum projects, which is why it is now possible to link JIRA to yourMendix Project. The Scrum Master of the project can choose betweenEpics or Jira in the Settings part of the project navigation, in theProject Management tab.

 {{< figure src="image/path" max-width=80% class="image-border"  >}}image26.png"
style="width:6.5in;height:5.54531in" /

Make sure that the tool and process you choose supports closecollaboration between the product owner, developers, users, and otherstakeholders. The tool should enable clear visibility and tracingbetween user stories, implementation, feedback, and deployments. Teammembers unfamiliar with your chosen tool may also need additionaltraining to maximize use of the tool.

## Lecture 6.4 Defining Requirements
If at all possible, make sure the development team talks to the futureend-users — this is what sprint zero is for. The team needs tounderstand what the app will be used for, what problem it is supposedto solve, how that problem is being solved now, and what can beimproved.

When defining requirements, try to not take things at face value. Yourstakeholders might have a clear list of requirements, but always startby making sure that you have a shared understanding of the problem(this is what the part about defining application value was for). Thenlook at the various ways you can help solve that problem — maybe thatfirst idea is not always the best one, and the way things have alwaysbeen done can be adapted for maximum efficiency.

Once the team has enough information, they should list the keyfeatures and functionalities that the application will offer. Thiscould include data entry forms, workflow automation, reporting tools,
or any other capabilities that align with the application's purpose.
Think about what the user needs to be able to do and how. 

Next step is to prioritize features based on their importance toachieving the primary goal. Remember, a minimum viable product is allabout achieving that initial value. Just because something is not apart of that scope, does not mean it’s considered unimportant or thatit will not get done. Often things your stakeholders, or evenend-users consider crucial are things they can probably live withoutfor a couple of weeks. And if done right, your team will have a rhythmthat ensures they consistently continue delivering value.

## Lecture 6.5 Standard Requirements and Reusability
There will always be requirements that are repeated for each and everyapplication you build, things like access management or standardizednavigation, or maybe things that each app you build needs to have whichare specific to your business. If you already see things like that, notethem down and think about whether it makes sense to add them to yourstandard company app template, or maybe to invest in creating a reusablecomponent, which will save you time in the long run. It's also ok tomove quickly for this first app and look into reusability later, some ofour most successful customers started like that!

Here is a couple of topics to keep in mind:

**End user login**

Every app will need a way for your end users to get access to it. Weadvise to use the [OIDC SSOmodule](/appstore/modules/oidc/) for (B2E)
apps you are developing. This is a sensible default as it is the easiestand most flexible approach for Single Sign-On and is supported byMicrosoft’s Entra ID and most other IdPs.  As an alternative you mayadvise [SAML](/appstore/modules/saml/)
(e.g. for regulated B2C-apps) or[LDAP](/appstore/modules/ldap/) foron-prem apps or the [Forgot MyPassword](/appstore/modules/forgot-password/)
module for non-SSO apps.

**Familiarize with the Marketplace**

Low-code development may be fast, but using modules or content fromthe Marketplace may even be faster. You may find modules relevant toyour portfolio or your first app in particular and create a shortlistfor your teams.  Marketplace content may be supported by Mendix,
Mendix partners or by the Mendix community.

## Lecture 6.6 Familiarize Yourself With Continuous Collaboration Through Mendix
One of the core values of the Mendix platform is continuouscollaboration between business and IT. We have already shown you howthat works in practice when it comes to aligning on wider strategicobjectives (your low-code vision), program goals as well as yourproject goals. Now it’s time to see how it all works throughout theapplication development lifecycle. 

 {{< figure src="image/path" max-width=80% class="image-border"  >}}image27.png"
style="width:6.5in;height:3.65625in" /

It all starts with your portfolio. You have already added a couple ofinitiatives in it, but now that you have the MVP scope of your firstapplication, add it in as a separate initiative and describe or linkto documentation showing what needs to be delivered exactly and why. 

You also have your application, so now you can link it to theinitiative. To do this, you just need to select *Edit initiative* andstart typing your app name to select it from the dropdown.

 {{< figure src="image/path" max-width=80% class="image-border"  >}}image28.png"
style="width:6.5in;height:5.88743in" /

If you are using Epics as your agile planning tool, you will be ableto link the right epics to this initiative. This means that anyone whoopens that initiative in Portfolio Management will be able to seedevelopment progress on the epic level.

 {{< figure src="image/path" max-width=80% class="image-border"  >}}image29.png"
style="width:6.5in;height:9.48723in" /

Another important part of collaboration in the application developmentlifecycle is the collaboration between the development team and theirend users. Mendix makes that super easy using the feedback module.
Your app users just need to click the *Feedback* button in your appand tell you what they like, need or miss, and your development teamwill be able to immediately respond. Once your app is live, the teamwill be able to set up a mini-survey to ask for user satisfaction, orget more targeted input by asking specific questions. Here you canread more on [the importance of user feedback for applicationdevelopment](https://www.mendix.com/blog/how-to-collect-and-analyze-user-feedback-in-your-app/).

## Lecture 6.7 The Development Process Itself and Why That’s Not a Part of This Guide
We have created this guide in order to help anyone who is in charge ofimplementing Mendix in their organization to hit the ground running.
The end goal of this phase is to bring your first app to life, but ifyou are working on managing the Mendix program, odds are you will notbe the person actually developing the app itself. Rather, your job isto enable the set up of everything, focus on the 5 P’s, and empowerthe development team to focus on development only. 

There are many dedicated resources on the platform to help new (orseasoned developers) get the most out of Mendix.So for the sake ofyour time, this guide’s length, and your sanity, let us skip a fewsteps ahead and pretend that the application is now almost ready.

## Lecture 6.8 Summary
By now most probably your first application has been developed and isready for launch! You’ve learned how to kick off your project and haveensured access for all stakeholders involved. You’ve also laid thefoundation for establishing an Agile way of working and made surethere is a clear understanding of project requirements shared amongstall stakeholders. Also, you are aware of what tools are in place tosupport continuous collaboration that you can leverage through Mendix.
Time to move on and prepare for launching your first application!

# Module 7: Launching Your First Application
## Module introduction (module tile): 

You’ve come a long way, and it is time to launch your firstapplication. This module covers all you need to know at this stage. 

## Learning Objectives
Well done, you’ve gone a long way and learned a lot through theprocess! It’s time to launch your first application. Exciting! 

By the end of this module, you will be able to: 

* Identify the different options available to test your application
* Describe the ways to promote your application
* Recognize the importance and options to maintain and upgrade yourapplication
## Lecture 7.1 Deploy Your Application
### Deploy your application to the Mendix Cloud
Deploying your application to the Mendix Cloud is a simple process,
that will give you access to all the features and services in theMendix Cloud. It requires only a few steps to set it up, which youonly need to do once for each application. Once the cloud settings ofyour application is done, you can deploy and redeploy your applicationwith just one click.  

Note that Mendix also offers [other deploymentoptions](/releasenotes/developer-portal/deployment/)
than the Mendix cloud e.g. to a private cloud if that’s a requirement.

### Obtain a licensed node
You can deploy your application for free on the Mendix Cloud. These[Free Apps havelimitations](/developerportal/deploy/mendix-cloud-deploy/#free-app)
when it comes to run time, features and resources. You can publishFree Apps to test the Mendix platform, a specific feature of toquickly prototype an application to test an idea. Once you decide totake your application to the next-level and start serious developmenton it, you will need to obtain a licensed node, so this is somethingyou will need to do before your launch.

If you have an existing contract that allows for more licensed nodes,
you can [request a new licensednode](/developerportal/deploy/licensing-apps/#31-obtaining-a-licensed-node).
If you don’t have a contract, or if your contract doesn’t allow formore licensed nodes, contact your Customer Success Manager.

### Link your application to your licensed node
If you have a licensed node available, you can link your applicationto this licensed node. If your application was published as a FreeApp, you will have to unlink the application from the Free Appenvironment first. This will delete all data on that Free Appenvironment. So, before you unlink your Free App, [back up thedata](/developerportal/deploy/licensing-apps/#backing-up)
first, if you require it.

If you have backed up your data, you can [unlink yourapplication](/developerportal/deploy/licensing-apps/#unlink-free)
from the Free App environment.

When your app is unlinked from a Free App environment, you can link itto a licensed node. By linking it to a licensed node, you get accessto all the features of the Mendix Cloud, such as one-click deploymentfrom Studio Pro and our platform, log management, backups managementand monitoring tools.

### Set node permissions
Once you have linked your application to a licensed node, your teamneeds to determine what users can perform what actions on the node.
Who can configure an environment, who can deploy to an environment,
who has access to the logs of an environment, etc. All of that iscontrolled by [nodepermissions](/developerportal/deploy/node-permissions/).
By default, only the Technical Contact of a node has permissions toperform any action on the licensed node. The Technical Contact cangrant permissions to other members of the app team.

Granting permissions to team members is dependent on your deploymentstrategy and process: do you have DevOps teams where the developersalso deploy and monitor the apps? Or does your company have separateOps teams, where the deployment is done by people other than thedevelopers? You can set node permissions for each of the environmentsof your node, so you can grant developers to deploy the app to theTest environment, but restrict deployment permissions for theProduction environment to a smaller team.

### Set cloud settings
When the node permissions are set up, you can start configuring yourcloud settings. This can be done by any team member with the correctpermissions. Changing your cloud settings is not mandatory, as most ofsettings are set for you by default in the Mendix Cloud, but in somecases you want to customize them to tailor the end user experience orto adhere to company standards.

Things can you can customize for your applications in the Mendix Cloudinclude:

* [Studio Pro deploymenttarget](/developerportal/deploy/studio-deployment-settings/#2-selecting-the-target-environment)

* [Customdomains](/developerportal/deploy/custom-domains/)

* [HTTPheaders](/howto/security/best-practices-security/#adding-http-header)

* [Path-based accessrestrictions](/developerportal/deploy/access-restrictions/)

* [Environmentvariables](/developerportal/deploy/environments-details/#custom-environment-variables)

* [Services](/developerportal/deploy/environments-details/#services),
such as [the Event Brokerservice](/appstore/services/business-events/#mendix-event-broker)

### Deploy your application
Once you have linked and configured your Mendix Cloud node, which youonly have to do once, you can start deploying your application to theMendix Cloud. It is recommended that you deploy any new version ofyour application to the Test or Acceptance environment of yourapplication first for testing, before deploying it to the Productionenvironment.

There are multiple ways to deploy your application to the MendixCloud, so there is always a deployment flow that fits your needs. You(or your team) can get a complete overview of those [in this docspage](/developerportal/deploy/mendix-cloud-deploy/#deploy-app-mendix-cloud).

## Lecture 7.2 Test Your Application
Mendix has a module that allows developers to write and execute UnitTests: the UnitTesting module in Marketplace. With the UnitTestingmodule, critical parts of the application can be tested.

There are a variety of tools available for testing, fromMendix-supported ones to third-party ones. Read more about [TestAutomation and QualityAssurance](https://www.mendix.com/evaluation-guide/app-lifecycle/test-automation-quality-assurance/).

Aside from unit tests, performance tests can also be performed withmultiple third-party tools, such as JMeter, BlazeMeter and LoadRunner– all of which are capable of testing the performance of your Mendixapplication.

After go-live, the Mendix Cloud offers metrics and logs to provideinsights into application performance and can help track down bugs.

## Lecture 7.3 User Acceptance Testing
Before launching your first application, it is important to thoroughlytest the application, not just in terms of bug bashing, but also tomake sure it fulfills end user needs. That is why User AcceptanceTests should be performed before any go-live. What does that mean?
It’s simple — always get your end users to actually try out the appbefore the go-live. This will give you the chance to catch anylast-minute bugs and make sure your app is meeting (and exceeding)
user expectations. 

Mendix feedback module makes it super easy to organize user acceptancetests, all you need to do is to select the environment you want to dothis in, make sure the feedback module is set up there, inform yourend-users that you need their help and give them information on how tolog in and how to provide feedback (maybe you want them to testspecific scenarios you would give them on advance, or just let themplay around themselves and give feedback on anything they notice mightneed to be changed). Then your development team will be able to fixany issues and respond to questions that might arise. Keep in mindthat they might need extra time to tackle this feedback, so be sureyou get user input at least a week before your planned go live date,
preferably even longer. 

## Lecture 7.4 Launch and Promote Your Application
Congratulations! If you made it this far, you’ve most likely launchedyour first Mendix app and have already started delivering value foryour organization. You’ve probably tried doing things a bitdifferently than before and your team, as well as your wholeorganization, learned a lot along the way. To ensure continuedsuccess, here are a couple of things you need to think about now.

**Celebrate your first launch**

Yes, you absolutely need to celebrate. Here are some tips to maximizethe impact of your internal celebration: 

* Throw a party and invite as many people as possible, not just yourdevelopment team. 

* Host the party in a central location so that other departments takenotice. 

* People love cake. To be more specific: people love free cake. Ordera cake. One of our customers in the shipping industry made theircake look like a shipping container because their app increased theutilization of their containers. You could make your cake look likea volcano, because business is about to erupt. 

* Make sure your most senior sponsor is in the room to reinforce theimportance of low-code development. 

* Captivate your audience by presenting the astonishing results ofyour project. Have the business show the demo.

* Here’s who you can consider inviting to celebrate with you: 

* Project team
* Business stakeholders 

* Stakeholders from other lines of business
* IT leaders
* Mendix Expert Services or the Partner that helped guide the teamthrough the project
But it doesn’t stop there. You need to continue talking about yourfirst success. This part might feel like shameless promotion, and itmight not come naturally to you or your team, but trust us, it’s vitaland it works. Some of our most successful customers went on to sharetheir success story in the form of a blog for your company website orintranet, a video, a podcast or at the very least a value one-pagerthat can be shared across your organization. Trust us, it’s worth it.

## Lecture 7.5 After the Launch
**Establish a retrospective cadence **

To achieve this milestone, it’s first important to establish the goalsof a retrospective. The retrospective should look back on the projectand review successes and lessons learned. 

1.  Did the project achieve its business goal? 

2.  Did you have the right people on the team? 

3.  How well was the business engaged in the process? 

Embrace all feedback, whether it’s perception or reality. Again, letthe business know they have a voice and that their input is vital toimproving future projects. Seek their advice on how to develop a morestructured rapid application development approach that furtherenhances engagement and collaboration with other business units.

One of the most important questions to ask the business stakeholdersin the retrospective is “What would you tell your friends/colleaguesabout this project to make them enthusiastic?” This elevator pitch isgreat fodder for internal feedback, with the goal of implementing thisapproach more broadly across the organization. To effectively engagethe business, you may have to reverse years of perception. The key isconstant communication and proof. Once business users see that youhave done what you said you would do — and that they can have asignificant impact on the project —they will quickly embrace this newapproach
Make sure to do a team retrospective as well, these are some of thepoints you can consider:

* What went well?

* What didn’t go well? 

* Who really excelled in the project and can take on the Mendixdeveloper lead role/advance their certification level?

* How can you use this information to refine your process for the nextproject?

**Document and measure the value of the application** 

Remember those goals you outlined when you initially defined the valueof your application? Now is the time to go back to them and see if youhave reached them or are on track to reach them.

It might take a bit of time to capture enough data to be able to drawconclusions, but always make sure the value the app brought about iscaptured. This might include things like generating additional revenueor maybe saving costs by sunsetting existing legacy apps, automatingpreviously manual processes, or simply delivering a new applicationfaster than you would with traditional development. It could even besomething like improving your customer satisfaction or engagement.
Whatever it is, make sure you have measured it and will continue tomeasure it. This will also be important when the time comes for you todefine the value of your second and third app.

## Lecture 7.6 Maintain and Upgrade Your Applications
**Platform: Maintaining your Mendix App**

After developing and publishing your first Mendix app, it's importantto put proper maintenance measures in place. [Establishing aregular upgradepractice](https://www.mendix.com/wp-content/uploads/Your-Mendix-Upgrade-Guide-1.pdf)
\[DB37]\[UT38]will help keep your app up to datewith support and retain access to the latest features.

Mendix supports three major versions at a time. For example, todayMendix supports major versions 8, 9, and 10. When the next version(11) is released, then version 8 will sunset, and versions 9, 10, and11 will be supported.
