## Lecture 1.2 Who This Guide Is For, How to Use It, and for How Long

This learning path is tailored for organizations new to Mendix,
especially for leaders responsible for implementing Mendix in their
company. It is designed to help you navigate your Mendix journey from
starting up until your first application is launched. It also reflects
the most common steps in that journey and is a collection of resources
you can use to ensure success on each of these steps.

>We will not talk about technical setup here, but will guide you
>through managing the organizational change along with all the initial
>decisions you will need to make to ensure success. Think of this
>learning path as your guide to getting started with Mendix at your
>company and if you are (a part of the team) in charge of making that a
>success, then this is the perfect starting point for you.
>
>The content in this learning path can be covered in a few hours, but
>it was designed as more of a guide versus a course, so you will likely
>come back to it as you are working towards getting that first app
>live. Our most successful customers tend to do that within 4-5 months,
>but the time frame heavily depends on your organization, the choice of
>that first app, and many other factors that will also influence how
>long you might find the content in this guide useful.
