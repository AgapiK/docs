## 1 Introduction

This learning path covers everything you need to know to get started
with Mendix in your company. This guide is meant for anyone who is in
charge of managing the entire Mendix program in an organization. It
will take you through defining your low code vision, defining
company-wide settings as well as kicking off what will become the
first app you will launch. Follow these steps to unlock the full
potential of the Mendix platform and accelerate your journey into the
digital execution practice.





# Module 3: Create a Getting Started Plan

## Lecture 3.1 Create (Or Revise) Your Low-Code Vision 

<span class="mark">\[Resources for this lecture Vision Preparation
Questions PDF\]</span>
>
We encourage you to take the time to develop a clear vision for
low-code development in your organization. It is critical to the
success of your low-code change initiative because it takes the
guesswork out of people trying to understand what you want to achieve.
Low-code shouldn't (and frankly, doesn't) operate in its own universe,
so the vision should be aligned and contribute to other visions,
values, strategies, and initiatives that are already in motion in your
organization.
>
There is a wide variety of ideas and opinions regarding the length,
form, structure, and scope of a vision. And your vision should reflect
your company's culture. We have compiled **a set of guidelines and
recommendations to help you in defining your vision**. Some are widely
recognized as best practices, and others are based on our extensive
experience. Your Mendix Transformation Manager, Digital Business
Advisor, or Customer Success Manager will be able to support you in
this endeavor. And if you have defined your low code vision already,
now is the perfect time to revisit it and make sure you are happy with
it. 
>
1\. **Preparation**
>
This step requires some analysis and time investment. Reference
company documents and talk to your team and other key stakeholders on
the business and technology side.
>
It is key to ensuring alignment and contribution to other visions,
values, strategies, and initiatives that are already in place in your
organization. We have included a list of useful questions to consider
in the supporting content for the preparation task (you can find this
in the resources, at the top of this page).
>
2\. **First iteration: Mind map / brainstorm**
>
Start exploring the areas that you want to transform. We recommend
thinking along the lines of the 5 P’s – People, Process, Platform,
Portfolio, Promotion – because these cover all the aspects you need
when undergoing a transformation. This also ties well into other tools
we use such as the Maturity Assessment, which is also grouped
according to the 5 P’s.
>
Imagine how you want those areas to look like in 3-4 years. That
timeframe is the perfect balance between realistic and achievable and
it gives you the chance to work on different aspects simultaneously.
More than that and it's too far in the future, too fuzzy, you can't
know what the world will look like in 10 years. Too short and there's
not enough time to do something impactful – it won't be inspirational.
Add key words to a mind map for each of the five areas.
>
3\. **Second iteration: Prioritize and add details**
>
Select the most important ideas and create full sentences as bullet
points, adding details so that anyone reading the sentence can
understand what it means.
>
You can also start adding key results or placeholders for them, such
as, "Achieve an ROI of \[amount\] by \[date\]".
>
4\. **Third iteration: Evaluate and refine**
>
Review and refine your bullet points. You need to ensure that you can
evaluate whether a particular point has been completed or achieved.
Finish adding relevant key results or placeholders. You may choose to
leave the actual numbers in the key results blank and ask your teams
or key people in your organization to set the ambition levels
themselves. This creates ownership and buy-in to your vision.
>
Once you have full sentences for all bullet points and the relevant
key results, you need to review them all, asking "Is this ambitious
enough or is it too ambitious?"
>
The objectives need to be achievable, but it also shouldn't be too
easy. You need to find that balance. But don't overthink it – you will
probably need to adjust some key results along the way, and that's OK.
More about that in the "Use your vision to steer your journey"
objective.
>
5\. **Socialize your vision and gather feedback**
>
Show your draft vision to key stakeholders and a selection of
employees to get their feedback. When others read your vision, they
need to experience a moment of awe and wonder. If their jaws don’t
drop a little bit, you need to think bigger. Small, safe, calculated
plans don’t inspire – a vision needs a wow factor. And don't be put
off if there’s a small number – around 10%-15% or so – who don't like
it.
>
What you don't want is indifference.
>
Check during this refining stage that people understand the vision –
and that it accurately represents what you want to achieve and what
your organization needs.
>
**6. Write your final version**
>
In this final stage, you need to consider what feedback is relevant
and what you want to incorporate.
>
If you think it would be more efficient, you might want to get support
from a writer to polish some of those sentences so they pop off the
page and resonate with your team and stakeholders. However, balance
the effort you invest – done is better than perfect!
>
**Communicate your vision effectively **
>
Once you have your vision, you need to communicate it effectively to
your team. You need to make sure that everyone understands it so that
they are motivated to work towards it. 
>
People should understand the significance of what they are doing. They
should feel connected to something larger than themselves. That gives
their work meaning and shows their value in the organization. That
sense of meaning and purpose is one of the most fulfilling outcomes of
a vision.
>
You may choose to have town halls or an all-hands to present it in
person. Others have made videos that can be shown asynchronously, and
that people can come back to for reference and for onboarding. Only
relying on the written word such as email is usually not dynamic or
inspiring enough for this type of communication. Be brave to try
something new, but choose a tone and method that feels authentic, too.

## Lecture 3.2 Build Your Getting Started Plan

As the primary person responsible for the implementation of Mendix
within your organization, it’s critical to have a plan for getting
started. So far, we’ve introduced the 5 P’s, and now it’s time to
think about how each of these relates to your own organization’s
success. Having a plan for getting started helps to build alignment
and buy-in among your business and IT stakeholders. Your low-code
vision, as discussed in the previous section, is critically important
to this plan.
>
First, work with stakeholders to align your start stage goals and key
challenges. These goals should be focused on what success looks like
for your team and how to measure it. Goals could be something like “At
the end of Q3, we will have at least two apps live” or “We want to
generate X-amount of ROI with our first application”. The start stage
is all about bringing together your first team, building, deploying,
and celebrating your first apps while defining a future portfolio
vision. Keep your start-stage goals related to these topics, but
customize them based on what you want to achieve. You should consider
your low-code vision as the future state you are working toward, then
break those into digestible goals for your getting started plan.
>
After you’ve established your goals, think about the challenges that
might get in your way and then build a mitigation plan to avoid those.
Is your team new to working in Agile? Adopting a new way of working
might be one of your challenges, and the getting started plan will
need to focus on how to bring your team up to speed. Think through any
factors that might hinder your progress and work with stakeholders on
how you’ll tackle them together.
>
Now that you have your goals and challenges identified, consider
milestones for each of the 5 P’s as part of your getting started plan.
Here are some ideas:

-   Portfolio

    -   First app identified

    -   App value definition completed

    -   First app live

    -   Portfolio defined

-   People

    -   First team trained

    -   Training and enablement plan defined

    -   Team growth strategy defined

-   Process

    -   Governance strategy defined

    -   Mendix support introduced

    -   Stage retrospective executed

-   Platform

    -   Deployment strategy defined

    -   Data and integration strategy defined

    -   Architecture strategy defined

-   Promotion

    -   Host a go-live celebration for first application

    -   Gather relevant stakeholders to show progress

    -   Share the success at company meeting or in newsletters

The final step of your getting started plan involves capturing your 5
P milestones and building a timeline. Below are some examples that we
use frequently with Mendix customers that you can take and make your
own: Add details, and overlay dates appropriate for your organization,
etc. Work independently or work with your customer success manager to
think through what this might look like for you.

## Lecture 3.3 Start Your Mendix Portfolio

Now let’s focus on developing your portfolio. Portfolio Management is
a top-down process led by a portfolio manager and decision-makers. Its
main purpose is to assess potential initiatives and ensure they align
with business goals. Initiatives that don't meet the criteria are
excluded from consideration.

To make sure that the strategy is reflected in the initiatives, you need
to put into place a program to ensure vision alignment at every level,
across every department. At this level, program owners or managers
empower collaboration across departments. This will ensure that every
solution will always meet the criteria and support the goals of the
vision. It’s about trying to create software that delivers immediate
value, which requires input from and collaboration with many people
across your organization.

Portfolio Management starts at the company level, where strategy is
defined. The company strategy leads to a Portfolio Vision, which is
translated into a backlog and budget for all initiatives. 
>
<img src="./markdown/media/image9.png"
style="width:6.5in;height:3.45677in" />
>
To start, think about the big picture: What is your organization
striving to achieve? Jot down a few ideas that can help you get there.
These could include solutions to migrate from legacy apps, improve
customer experience or increase efficiency. And Mendix has a tool to
help you do just that!
>
You should have already created your portfolio in lecture 2.5, if you
haven’t yet let’s start by creating your Portfolio board, you can do
that by going [<u>here</u>](https://portfolio.mendix.com/), clicking
Open Portfolio Management and then click **Create Portfolio.**You can
make it restricted for the time being (that means you will have to
approve other people before they gain access to it).  
>
If you have done a portfolio workshop already and maybe have your list
of initiatives in an Excel file, you can easily import them. If not,
just create a few cards that represent your ideas. Your Mendix team
can also help you with this, so please do not hesitate to reach out to
them to go over everything together.
>
Portfolio management is a key activity that ensures you are always
creating solutions that bring the most value to your organization (and
since we’re talking Mendix here, this is where you also decide if
Mendix is the right tool for each one of the ideas). This means that
you (maybe together with your stakeholders) need to go over your main
portfolio, keep initiatives up to date and adjust or reprioritize if
needed. You can learn a lot more about this process in the dedicated
learning path <u>. For now, the most important thing is to list the
initiatives that are top of mind for you and use that input to choose
the ideal first app. </u>
>
So, let’s add your initiatives. Click the *Create Initiative* button
on the top right and start jotting down your ideas.

## Lecture 3.4 Finalize First Application Selection 

It’s important that your first applications bring immediate value upon
launch, because rapid application development isn’t just about
delivering rapidly, it’s about realizing value quicker than you have
before. 
>
We recommend that you start with adding at least three applications
ideas to your portfolio. While the first success is always important,
to truly grasp the new rapid application development process and the
Mendix platform, developing multiple apps and demonstrating repeated
success is a best practice. 
>
As for your very first project, you want to pick a use case out of
your portfolio that is equal parts meaningful and doable. A great
first project is something that impacts the enterprise positively but
can be completed by a relatively small team in a reasonable
timeframe. 
>
Here’s a **quick checklist of things to consider when choosing your
first application**:
>
**Go live quickly:** One of the main goals of your first application
is to validate your ability to rapidly bring new ideas to market. It’s
important that you identify quick wins, so select applications that
are limited in scope and can stand alone in production. 
>
**Make them worthy:** The first application should also be highly
visible within the organization. It must have the right urgency and
executive support, and also deliver tangible business value. Select an
app idea where you’re sure the results will get noticed and the
success will be shared by your stakeholders. 
>
**Involve business stakeholders:** Requirements are often unclear and
need to be refined through collaboration with, and feedback from,
business stakeholders. The goal is to illustrate the higher level of
creativity and collaboration facilitated by this new rapid application
development approach.   The key to involving business stakeholders
lies with the role of the product owner. The product owner knows what
needs to be built. Application success is achieved when the
development team and product owner work together with a passion for
making applications that deliver value. 
>
**Limit dependencies:** External factors over which you have little,
or no control can quickly diminish the productivity advantage offered
by the Mendix platform. That’s like using a permanent marker on a
brand-new whiteboard. 
>
**Don’t get bogged down in requirements:** Digital innovation projects
are often marked by unclear business requirements. Don’t worry; this
is a good thing, because it is better to define a high-level goal or
purpose versus having detailed requirements. The more requirements
your first applications have upfront, the longer it’s going to take to
release. Make sure that you have at least two follow-up iterations
planned so that you can capture and refine requirements and build
trust with the business stakeholders. This shows them that even if
their requirements don’t make it into the initial MVP, they will come
in the next versions. 
>
**Make failures into wins:** It’s ok to admit defeat. In this case,
it’s actually beneficial. It may sound contradictory, but good first
applications are often ones that your organization previously failed
to deliver.
>

>
For instance, a Mendix customer initially failed to build an
application that calculates prices because the algorithm was so
specific to the business, and the .NET developer couldn’t grasp all
the nuances. Using Mendix, business stakeholders and IT developers
were able to take that failure and turn it into a win, collaborate
much more closely, and successfully deliver a first version of the
application in a few days. 
>
**Make them smart:** To ensure that apps deliver the best possible
experience to the user, they should be intelligent, contextual and
proactive — i.e., smart. Develop an app that uses AI to personalize a
user’s experience or uses geolocation to tell let you know the
location for the cake you ordered for your big app launch party. 
>
**The complexity matrix:**
>
Using the complexity matrix is a great way to assess the right
projects for your Start stage portfolio. 
>
**Exposure** is the amount of usage or availability an application
has. **Complexity** can be defined as how technically complex the
application is; i.e., how many integrations does the application
require? You want to start on the left-hand side of the quadrant,
which represents your team learning and feeling comfortable with the
new way of working. 
>
<img src="./markdown/media/image11.png"
style="width:6.5in;height:6.57431in"
alt="A white grid with black text Description automatically generated" />
>
**Which type of projects is Mendix a good fit for? **
>
Another thing that might help is understanding which type of projects
Mendix is the best fit for (and which ones are not a great fit).
Here’s a little guide for that.
>
**Mendix fits a wide variety of software applications, but some really
stand out as a perfect fit: **

-   Any software requirement where there is no off-the-shelf solution
    available 

-   Software projects when the requirements are not very clear yet and
    the business also requires flexibility during the development
    process 

-   Software projects where there is going to be a high degree of
    business involvement during the development process 

-   Situations where the customer wants to build multiple applications
    and they want to benefit from reusing components 

-   Applications that require multichannel (desktop/mobile/tablet etc.) 

-   Workflow applications 

-   Customer-facing applications that need to be pixel perfect 

-   Flexible applications: applications that start small but need to be
    able to scale up 

-   Applications that require governance, since things like audit and
    traceability are built in the platform 

-   Projects where resources are scarce, since Mendix is easy to learn
    developers can be trained internally and citizen developers can be
    used 

-   Applications that the customer wants to maintain and support
    themselves 

-   Projects where changes after go-live are likely to happen 

-   Internal work portals 

-   Process-oriented applications 

-   Integrations applications 

-   Applications that require data-management 

-   Applications that replace Excel applications 

-   Applications that have integrations with other platforms and systems
    (like SAP) 

-   Projects that are going to replace a legacy application 

-   Any new solutions where the data is also going to be stored in the
    application 

-   Extensions of System of Record (ERP/PLM/MES etc.) 

**Which type of projects would Mendix potentially not be the perfect
fit for? **
>
Even though you can build almost anything with Mendix, especially with
the extensibility of the platform using Java, Mendix might not be the
perfect fit for every application. Below are some examples of
applications where additional work needs to be done. 

-   Games (as Mendix is aimed to build business applications) 

-   Content Management Systems, but Mendix can integrate well with
    existing CMS for creating CMS portals and such 

-   Data warehouse applications, similar to CMS, Mendix can integrate
    well with existing data warehouse applications 

-   Enterprise Service Bus applications. When the main purpose is to
    connect applications with other applications, without adding
    business value/logic, Mendix might not be the best fit 

-   Applications with heavy mathematical calculations, but Mendix would
    be a good layer on top of an AI solution or calculation engine that
    compute statistical models or data analytics 

-   Web portals with more than 10,000 concurrent users 

-   Mobile applications with more than 100,000 concurrent users 

-   Applications where the main goal is to visualize data 

## Lecture 3.5 Define Application Value

<span class="mark">\[Lecture Resource Value Template for Customers
PPT)</span>

By thoroughly defining the application’s purpose and value, you
provide a clear roadmap for development, aligning the project with
organizational goals, and setting the stage for successful
implementation and adoption. What will help you do that is trying to
think along these lines:

1.  **Business value proposition:**

    -   Clearly articulate the value proposition of the application. Ask
        yourself: What problem does this application solve? What
        specific business process or pain point does it address? How
        does it contribute to the organization's success? What benefits
        will it bring to the business, such as cost savings, revenue
        generation, or improved customer satisfaction?

2.  **User experience and satisfaction:**

    -   Identify the target audience or users who will benefit from the
        application. Understanding the end-users helps in tailoring the
        application to their needs.

    -   Consider the user experience as a critical aspect of the
        application's value. An intuitive and user-friendly interface
        enhances user satisfaction and adoption.

    -   Value is often derived not just from functionalities but also
        from how easily and effectively users can accomplish their
        tasks.

3.  **Efficiency and productivity:**

    -   Assess how the application improves operational efficiency and
        productivity. Identify areas where manual processes can be
        automated, reducing errors and saving time.

    -   Highlight any potential cost savings or resource optimization
        achieved through the application.

4.  **Innovation and competitive advantage:**

    -   If applicable, emphasize how the application introduces
        innovative solutions or features that set your organization
        apart from competitors.

    -   Consider how the application positions the organization for
        future growth and adaptation to changing market conditions.

5.  **Adaptability and scalability:**

    -   Highlight the application's adaptability to changing business
        needs and its scalability to accommodate future growth. A
        valuable application is one that can evolve with the
        organization.

6.  **Measurable objectives:**

    -   Establish measurable objectives to gauge the success of the
        application. Define key performance indicators (KPIs) that will
        help evaluate its impact on business processes, efficiency, or
        other relevant metrics.

    -   Measurable objectives provide a basis for assessing the
        application's effectiveness and return on investment.

7.  **Alignment with organizational goals:**

    -   Confirm that the application purpose aligns with the overall
        goals and vision of the organization. It should contribute
        positively to the strategic direction of the company.

    -   Understand how the application fits into the larger ecosystem of
        organizational processes and systems.

this template attached in the Resources box at the top of this page):

## Lecture 3.6  Set up Deployment Architecture and Resources

Mendix applications can be deployed in different ways, mainly:

1.  Public

2.  Private

3.  On-premise

**Mendix Public Cloud** is the default deployment option and has the
advantage of being a fully integrated solution, with easy setting up
and administrating. When developing your first application and if
there are no specific (private) cloud constraints, it makes sense to
choose the user friendly Mendix Cloud option. Within Mendix Cloud,
there are options for multi-tenant cloud environments and
single-tenant cloud environments. Deploying to Mendix Cloud gives you
the shortest time-to-value.
>
Mendix can also be deployed to any cloud platform which supports a
version of Cloud Foundry. With **Mendix for Private Cloud**, you can
choose the cloud provider of your preference, e.g. your own Azure or
AWS infrastructures. If there already is access to an on-premise
hosting environment, Mendix can also be deployed on-premise.
>
When setting up your deployment strategy, it is important to look at
the features that are needed, as some features that rely on the target
platform can work differently.
>
If your organization is deploying on **Private Cloud or on-prem**,
please **make sure that you are ready to take on the effort and
responsibility of managing all hosting and support of the application
deployments**.
>
For a list of all the deployment options that are available, see:
[<u>https://docs.mendix.com/developerportal/deploy/</u>](https://docs.mendix.com/developerportal/deploy/). 
>
Some highlights to consider:
>
**Mendix Public Cloud:**

-   Pros: Fast and easy, all hosting is taken care of.  It has the best
    utilization rate for your infrastructure allowing you to maintain
    optimal flexibility and convert your capital investment into
    operational expenses. This option is supported by Mendix and it is
    the most optimized cloud to run Mendix applications.

-   Cons: Some organizations don’t allow shared cloud usage and require
    air-gapped or private-cloud options

**Mendix Private Cloud:**

-   Pros: Your DevOps team has complete control over application
    deployment and application lifecycle, with centralized
    management. It is cloud agnostic, and you can choose on-premise or
    your chosen cloud provider.

-   Cons: Requires your own experienced staff to set up and maintain
    with reduced Mendix Support due to lack of access and visibility.

For Private deployment , **please be ready to start that process
immediately in order to avoid development and go-live date delays**. 
>
See below for Private Cloud responsibility matrix:

## Lecture 3.7 Review Options for Development Resources (Who Will Build Your First App?)

With Mendix, you have multiple options to choose from for the
development of your applications:

1.  **In-house development**

    1.  Train and/or hire Mendix developers to develop and support all
        your Mendix applications.

When training in-house, we recommend choosing individuals who either
have a traditional development background or have some understanding
of OOP (object-oriented programming).  We’ve also seen individuals
without a technical background succeed if they have the right
problem-solving mindset!  Beyond the technical side, you also want to
look for individuals who can provide consulting to your business
team. Mendix development is quick and Agile, and you need someone who
can speak to not only the technical side of Mendix but also the
business side at the same time in order to prevent project
bottlenecks.

1.  **Mendix partner**

    1.  Bring in one of our certified Mendix partners to support your
        app development.  Our directory of partners is listed
        [here](https://developerprofiles.mendix.com/link/partneroverview),
        but your Mendix team is a great resource to identify a good fit
        for you.

This can be a great option to get your project kick-started, or if you
have no future goals of building out your internal development team.

1.  **Mendix Expert Services**

    1.  Our team of experts are here to support you! We have many
        options for enabling your team and helping you quickly
        demonstrate the power of Mendix.

Choosing Expert Services is the right option if you plan on building
out your internal team and need enablement and support alongside
application development.  Expert Services can help prove the value of
the Mendix internally while simultaneously coaching your team on how
to continue with the application(s).

1.  **Hybrid**

    1.  You can simultaneously grow your in-house team and supplement
        with a Mendix partner and/or our Expert Services team

Regardless of which option you choose, we always recommend that at
least one person internally has been trained on Mendix and is
technically capable of directing the project.  Outsourcing every
technical role creates a siloed development team that does not truly
understand your business needs.

Defining and honing your development process is a critical factor in
program success. By nature of low-code, **the [Agile
Framework](https://www.mendix.com/agile-framework/) is the best way to
work with Mendix.**
>
Understanding how to work in Agile allows organizations to [stay
responsive to
change](https://s2.bl-1.com/h/i/dtfq477y/xKsSFL1?url=https://www.mendix.com/blog/design-thinking-vs-agile-combine-problem-finding-problem-solving-better-outcomes/)
and reduce time-to-market by nearly 50%. Mendix highlights these
benefits by providing capabilities such as sprints, story management,
and integrated feedback management within the platform itself.
>
In the Academy, you can find an [<u>Agile Awareness learning
path</u>](https://academy.mendix.com/link/paths/110/Agile-Awareness)
that you can use to train your team in the Agile Framework and how it
will define your Mendix journey. 

## Lecture 4.2 Identify Your First Mendix Project Team

This section addresses how you set up your first Mendix Project Team.
Ensuring you have the right people in the right roles is a critical
step in successfully getting started. Everyone participating should be
interested and enthusiastic about learning how to leverage this
powerful platform, how to constantly improve collaboration and best
practices across roles and groups within the BizDevOps model, and how
the work they’ll be doing will bring value to the end users and the
overall organization.
>
**Setting up your Agile Scrum team**
>
To work in Mendix, we recommend working in an Agile Scrum Team that is
already familiar with the Agile Framework (if needed, refer to this
[<u>Agile Awareness Learning
Path)</u>](https://academy.mendix.com/link/paths/110/Agile-Awareness).
This framework allows development teams to collaborate better, respond
to change, and continuously incorporate user feedback.
>
It’s important to have small cross-functional teams to make sure that
knowledge of all aspects is available within the team with all roles
being covered. If needed, a person can take on multiple roles as long
as they have the skills, expertise, and time to commit to each role.
Ideal Scrum Teams are composed of 5-7 people, never exceeding nine for
larger enterprises. 
>
Getting all the required knowledge in each team might be difficult
while keeping your team small, efficient, and aligned. Mendix
considers a Scrum team as a juncture of a **core team** and
**accelerators**. 
>
**<u>Core Team:</u>**

-   **Product Owner (PO):** responsible for defining the direction of a
    project. They have a clear understanding of what the business and
    users need from the product being developed and the value to be
    delivered. They translate these needs to the Scrum team. The PO:

    -   Is a liaison between the business and the development team to
        build, prioritize, and manage the backlog to drive production
        forward.

    -   Ensures the product being developed delivers the required value
        for the business and users. 

    -   Accepts or rejects the completed work

Ideal POs have these five key [<u>skills &
characteristics.</u>](https://www.mendix.com/blog/5-important-product-owner-skills-for-rapid-app-dev/)

-   **Scrum Master (SM):** ensures that the team follows Agile best
    practices and ioversees addressing and removing any productivity
    blockers that may come up. Essentially, the Scrum master is the
    authority in Agile and Scrum to keep the team working together
    efficiently and effectively. SMs:

    -   Should be supportive leaders. 

    -   Help POs define the product’s value, plan work, and manage the
        backlog. 

    -   Help developers self-organize.

-   **Development Team:** consists of the people who actually build the
    app. They are responsible for turning the requirements into
    functionality, based on the input provided by the Product Owner. The
    development team:

    -   Is comprised of one or more people with the skills needed to
        build the product as envisioned by the PO.

    -   May be comprised of non-developers and traditional developers
        alike: architects, writers, technical BAs, designers, and other
        specialized roles can all be part of the development team. 

    -   Work with the SM in the key Scrum activities of sprint planning,
        sprint review, retrospectives and daily standups to keep their
        assigned tasks on track with high-quality code during each
        sprint, while working towards continuous improvement as a team.

**<u>Accelerators:</u>**

-   **BAs or SMEs** get involved when a team requires detailed knowledge
    about such subjects as UX/UI, QA, testing and integration. 

-   **The Business Owner** is the primary stakeholder who is ultimately
    responsible and accountable for the end-result of the project and
    product including the actual value delivered. 

-   **Stakeholders** are the end-users of the product under development,
    represent strategical, tactical, and operational levels of the
    business. 

Your team does not have to fit this exact mold, but it is important
that all the responsibilities outlined here are covered to ensure
success in your low-code program. Here’s a typical team structure:

## Lecture 4.3 Arrange Academy Training for Your Team

As you begin to map out your Mendix team, it's important to establish
a training plan. Properly training your Mendix team helps accelerate
your time to first value and promotes long-term low-code success. It
helps each team member take charge of their own success and the
overall team’s success.
>
Take the time to familiarize yourself with the [<u>Mendix
Academy</u>](https://academy.mendix.com/link/home). Here, we provide a
variety of learning paths and individual courses for various roles and
diverse backgrounds to allow you to customize the learning journey
appropriate for each team member and role. Once you are familiar with
the various learning paths, diverse topics and individual courses,
create a training plan with each team member based on their role and
experience. 
>
Here is a sample you can use as a template:
>
<img src="./markdown/media/image15.png"
style="width:6.5in;height:3.6519in" />
>
This will vary based on the specific people taking each role. A Scrum
Master who used to be a full-stack developer could take the *Crash
Course* instead of the *Become a Rapid Developer* course. Your EA may
need to add *Native Mobile* or *Configure Advanced Security* for your
particular organization, project and team needs. Your Mendix team is
happy to help create your training plan.
>
**Mendix Certificates **
>
Mendix provides four different certification levels to measure
developer maturity, each with an increasing level of required skill
and experience:
>
<img src="./markdown/media/image16.png"
style="width:6.5in;height:1.44219in" />
>
**Rapid Developer Certification**
>
A Rapid Developer has a baseline knowledge of the Mendix platform and
knows where to find information using the documentation and forum.
This certification is proof of basic Mendix knowledge and demonstrates
that someone can join a project team and independently build
prototypes.
>
The Rapid Developer certification is a minimum requirement for working
in Mendix. Before taking a certification exam, there is required
coursework for each level. All courses can either be taken via
[[<u>instructor-led</u>](https://academy.mendix.com/link/classrooms)](https://academy.mendix.com/link/classrooms)
<u>or via a</u>
[<u>[self-led](https://academy.mendix.com/link/paths)</u>](https://academy.mendix.com/link/paths)
<u>. </u>
>
You can find all the details about the certification, as well as the
required coursework
[<u>here</u>](https://academy.mendix.com/link/certifications/23/rapid). 
>
As your team grows and takes on more projects, it's important to
continue to also level up on your Mendix expertise. Proper enablement
will allow your team to take on more complex projects and deliver more
business impact. When able, remember to take the time to level up on
your Mendix Certification.
>
**Intermediate Developer Certification **
>
An Intermediate Developer has the fundamental knowledge of the Mendix
platform to start building the next great apps. This certification is
proof that someone is ready to be added to operating teams and can
contribute from the start by applying your knowledge and skills in
different parts of the project development lifecycle.
>

>
 You can find information as well as required courseware for the
Intermediate certification
[<u>here</u>](https://academy.mendix.com/link/certifications/22/intermediate). 
>
**Advanced Developer Certification**
>
An Advanced Developer has the knowledge and skills required to build
production-ready applications. This certification is proof of
someone’s advanced knowledge of the platform and their professional
experience with developing Mendix apps.
>
 You can find information as well as required courseware for the
Advanced certification
[here](https://academy.mendix.com/link/certifications/6/advanced). 
>
**Expert Developer Certification **
>
The Expert Developer Certificate is not only proof of Mendix
knowledge, it confirms a developer’s expertise and shows they have
applied what they know about Mendix in their day-to-day job.
>
 You can find information as well as required courseware for the
Advanced certification
[<u>here</u>](https://academy.mendix.com/link/certifications/24/expert). 

## Lecture 4.4 Organize Your Program Kick-Off

The program kick-off is important to hold before the project kick-off
as this meeting ensures alignment across all groups and team members
involved, from leadership to the development team, on goals, vision,
and value.  This meeting sets the foundation for bridging business and
IT as you begin your Mendix journey.
>
**Who should be there?**
>
Make sure to include the relevant business and IT leaders, project
team members, other stakeholders, Mendix and/or Mendix partner team
members. If your executive sponsor could also be there, that would be
amazing.
>
**What’s the agenda?**
>
A sample agenda of a successful program kickoff can include:

-   A round of introductions

-   Why Mendix was chosen

-   Business and IT alignment on:

    -   Organizational challenges and needs Mendix is solving (this is
        where your low-code vision will be very important — you always
        need to be able to tie Mendix work back to the larger business
        needs)

    -   An overview of Mendix vision and strategy for your organization

        -   Goals and success at both the organizational and project
            levels

        -   Important milestones 

        -   Value measurement and impact

    -   Identify initial concerns or challenges and build mitigation
        plans(s)

-   Establish a cadence for this group to meet going forward for a
    business review - quarterly, every other month, monthly, etc.

## 4.5 Summary

Amazing, you should have kicked-off your Mendix Program by now! During
this phase you:

-   Made sure the right Expert Leads and Stakeholders needed for your
    Mendix program are involved.

-   Familiarized with the agile framework and its benefits, and decided
    whether or not to use this way of working.

-   Built your first Mendix project team and arranged Academy training
    based on their role and needs.

-   Planned a successful program kick-off.

You are now ready to move to the next phase. Good job! 

# Module 5: Governance and Control in Mendix

## Module introduction (module tile): 

In this module, you will get a quick view on the features we offer to
incorporate governance in your process. We will show you in detail
which of these you need to configure at the start, so the platform
supports your organisation’s onboarding.

## Learning Objectives

Now that you have kicked-off your Mendix Program, it’s time to
familiarize with the features Mendix offers to incorporate governance in
your process.

By the end of this module, you will be able to:

-   Recognize the options Mendix offers to tailor the platform to your
    specific governance needs

-   Identify the required steps to Configure the Platform in Control
    Center

## Lecture 5.1 Introduction to Governance in Mendix

Low-code governance is about having oversight and maintaining control
over both a landscape of apps and individual app development. It
provides guardrails for your development process  
and brings resources together to achieve the enterprise’s objectives.
Increase accountability,  
increase transparency, and get the most ROI out of what your teams
build and deploy.  
It will help you maximize business value at acceptable risk and cost.
Knowing the broad strokes capabilities of the Mendix platform early on
helps in getting solid early successes.
>
When you start, the governance responsibility will probably be in the
hands of your Mendix admin, but as your Mendix landscape grows you may
want to define a Center of Excellence. Admins can use Control Center,
a dashboard that gives you an overview of various company activities
on the Mendix platform, to manage many of the aspects of landscape
governance.  
<img src="./markdown/media/image17.png"
style="width:6.25in;height:3.33333in" />
>
There are several advanced capabilities in the Control Center to help
you manage your app landscape as it grows.

-   [Dashboard](https://docs.mendix.com/control-center/dashboard/)
    provides insight into some KPIs of how your company is advancing.

-   [Apps](https://docs.mendix.com/control-center/apps/) provides easy
    visibility into all apps, environments, their deployment status,
    technical contact, version, and more.

-   [Health
    dashboard](https://docs.mendix.com/control-center/application-health-dashboard/)
    provides an insight into the running status of your app landscape.

-   [Entitlements](https://docs.mendix.com/control-center/entitlements/)
    shows the resources you’ve bought and used.

-   You can add, resize or remove environments in the [Deployed
    apps](https://docs.mendix.com/control-center/deployed-apps/) view.

-   Additional curation settings are available for
    [Marketplace](https://docs.mendix.com/control-center/private-marketplace/),
    [Portfolios](https://docs.mendix.com/control-center/portfolios/),
    and [Data
    Catalog](https://docs.mendix.com/control-center/catalog-admin/),
    which apply to all your developers.

New capabilities are released regularly, so exploring Control Center
regularly is always a good idea!

But as you can tell from the slide below, governance touches many
aspects of the development cycle and it’s not just confined to control
center.

<img src="./markdown/media/image18.png"
style="width:6.36055in;height:3.28628in" />

If you would like to learn more about our governance features, you can
check out the [Control Center
Guide,](https://docs.mendix.com/control-center/) [Control center
learning
path](https://academy.mendix.com/link/paths/116/Govern-and-Scale-your-App-Landscape-with-Mendix-Control-Center),
or the Mendix documentation. You probably already involved your subject
matter experts while you were evaluating Mendix, so they might want to
do a deeper dive.

A lot of these options will become more relevant for you as you scale
your Mendix portfolio, so for now, we will just point to a couple of key
settings that are important for getting started and launching your first
app.

## Lecture 5.2 Configure the Platform in Control Center

The Mendix platform has a few options to tailor the platform to your
specific governance needs. 
>
**Claim additional email domains
 **<img src="./markdown/media/image19.png"
style="width:0.22222in;height:0.22222in" alt="direct hit" / 
<img src="./markdown/media/image20.png"
style="width:5in;height:2.19792in" />
>
If your company has more than one email domain, all your email domains
should be claimed, such as: MyCompany.com, MyCompany.nl,
MyCompany-SpecialUnit.com etc. This is to ensure all users that do a
signup with an email address on any of these domains all end-up in the
same ‘company’ on the Mendix platform. If you don’t do this from the
start, your users may create projects in different ‘companies’/tenants
on the Mendix platform, which is hard to govern and may require
cumbersome merging activities later.
>
[You can read more about that,
here.](https://docs.mendix.com/control-center/company-settings/#company-email-domains)
>
**Assign a security contact**  
<img src="./markdown/media/image21.png"
style="width:3.50864in;height:1.47929in" / 
Provide a specific **Security Contact** who is informed if there are
critical security issues with the Mendix platform and
platform-supported Marketplace components. Mendix strongly recommends
applying a team email address or a functional mailbox instead of a
personal individual email address.
>
Your security contact person(s) may want to subscribe the [<u>Mendix
Security
Advisories</u>](https://docs.mendix.com/releasenotes/security-advisories/)
to get familiar with the process around security fixes.

[Additional
reading](https://docs.mendix.com/control-center/company-settings/#security-contact)

**Define company brand and description**
<img src="./markdown/media/image19.png"
style="width:0.22222in;height:0.22222in" alt="direct hit" / 
<img src="./markdown/media/image22.png"
style="width:5in;height:3.63542in" / 
On the **Company Brand** page, you can upload, edit, or remove a
**Company Logo**. The company logo uploaded here will appear across
the platform where it is used. For instance, it will be displayed on
your published Marketplace content.
>
[Additional
reading](https://docs.mendix.com/control-center/company-brand/)
>
**Setup IDP or SSO for access to the Mendix platform**
<img src="./markdown/media/image23.png"
style="width:0.22222in;height:0.22222in" alt="direct hit" />
>
It is recommended that you [<u>set-up
SSO</u>](https://docs.mendix.com/control-center/security/set-up-sso-byoidp/)
between the Mendix platform and your corporate IDP such as Microsoft
Entra ID (f.k.a. Azure AD) or Okta.  This will put your IDP in control
of how users are authenticated before they can access your content on
the Mendix platform. Leavers (former employees) will not be able to
login. Your platform users get the convenience of Single Sign-On,
rather than yet-another-password. See also our [<u>BYOIDP
blog</u>](https://www.mendix.com/blog/introducing-byoidp-bring-your-own-identity-provider/).
>
Optionally, you may set up access rules in your IDP to control which
of your employees can and cannot work on the Mendix platform. As we
encourage collaboration in multi-disciplined teams, be careful not to
be too restrictive or not apply any restriction at all. For example,
potential end-users of Mendix apps may want to contribute to
development teams. In a later stage you can set up restrictive access
rules as you start putting more business-critical IPs in the logic of
your Mendix apps.

### Setup password policy

If you don’t enable SSO, you will want to specify if the user
passwords expire or not. If you do not want the passwords to expire,
toggle **Passwords of company members never expire** to **On**.  


##  Lecture 5.3 Summary

Now that you know how Mendix can be tailored to your own governance
needs, you are ready to get your first project started! You will find
all the useful information to do this in the following module.

# Module 6: Get Started With Your First Project

## Module introduction (module tile): 

In this module, you will get all the information you need to know to
help you get started with your first Mendix project.

## Learning Objectives

It’s now time to begin your first Mendix project! How exciting!
>
By the end of this module, you will be able to: 

-   Organize your first project kick-off

-   Create your project

-   Ensure project access for all of your team members

-   Set up the agile way of working

-   Define requirements for your first project 

-   Identify continuous collaboration that you can leverage through
    Mendix

## Lecture 6.1 Organize Your First Project Kick-off

Now that the program is properly kicked off, the next step is to
organize the kick-off for your first project. Kick-off meetings are a
great way to communicate key project information to your team and give
them an opportunity to ask questions. You might also want to have your
key stakeholders in the same (physical or virtual) room. 

A sample agenda for a successful project kickoff might include:

-   Introduction: Make sure everyone knows each other.

-   The background of the project i.e. why are you doing it in the first
    place? (Go back to your application value definition and simply
    present the most important points to your team).

-   What is the project scope: You might not have your MVP scope defined
    in the kick-off meeting and that’s ok. What is important is to have
    a clear understanding of the problem you are solving and what the
    most crucial aspect of that problem to tackle first.

-   Who’s doing what: Here every team member should have a clear
    understanding of their roles and responsibilities (in the context of
    the scrum framework as well as in general).

-   How are you going to work together: Establish your agile rituals
    (standups, refinements, reviews, retrospectives) and decide who
    should be attending and how often. In general, all team members will
    be coming to all the rituals, but your stakeholders will not. The
    only thing that is super important for your stakeholders to attend
    is the sprint review.

-   What does success look like: How will you know if you have delivered
    value? These could be project milestones, but also metrics you would
    like to influence.

## Lecture 6.2 Create Your Project and Make Sure Everyone Has Access

Anyone can sign up to the Mendix platform using their business email
address, so there is no need to on-board a specific list of users. All
they need to do is go to
[<u>signup.mendix.com</u>](http://signup.mendix.com) and use the
relevant company email domain (any from the list you have added in
lecture 5.2). 
>
If you are working with implementation partners, you need to decide
**how to give those team members access to your app projects**.
>
You may take one of the following approaches:

-   One possibility is to invite external users to your app projects
    using their external email address (e.g. Joan@MyMendixPartner.com).

-   Another possibility is to create accounts for them in your company’s
    Entra ID (or similar IdP such as Okta).

**Create your first app!**
>
And now that everyone has a Mendix account, this is the moment you’ve
all been waiting for — it’s time to actually create your first app!
Anyone from your team can click the Create App button on the Mendix
platform, just make sure they are logged in with an email address from
your company domain.
>
<img src="./markdown/media/image24.png"
style="width:6.5in;height:3.16367in" />
>
Once the project is created, everyone from the team should get access
to it as well as their appropriate role. This is the overview of the
default project roles on the Mendix platform: 
>
<img src="./markdown/media/image25.png"
style="width:6.5in;height:3.02148in" />

## Lecture 6.3 Setting up the Agile Way of Working

Sprint Zero is all about laying the groundwork for a successful
project by focusing on planning and preparation rather than
immediately jumping into development. It might seem like this is a
whole lot of process while the team is ready to get to building, but
especially for your first project, it is crucial to set up the right
process, get everyone comfortable with it and define the initial
requirements — this will absolutely speed you up very soon. 
>
Let’s start by setting up your agile ways of working. You might have
defined some things already in your project kick-off, so you can start
by revisiting that. Moving forward, you also need to determine which
Agile practices will become your organizational standard: this could
be Scrum (the Mendix platform is optimized for Scrum at team level),
Kanban, or other variants. Creating a standard doesn't mean that all
teams will be forced to work in exactly the same way, but having a
shared set of practices will increase mobility between teams. The more
familiar and standardized this methodology is across your
organization, the tighter the collaboration will be amongst teams as
team members understand expectations and roles. 
>
However, it should be noted that your agile methodology should remain
lightweight and flexible to keep administrative burden as low as
possible while maximizing the benefits to your organization. The way
of working should suit the team's needs, so that they can get the best
out of themselves. Take a pragmatic approach so that this can be
discovered progressively. 
>
Regardless of Agile methodology, some of the practices that you can
consider standardizing are: 

-   Sprint 0 (or design sprints) 

-   Daily stand-ups

-   Sprint planning

-   Backlog refinement

-   Product demos

-   Team retrospectives

Care should be taken to incorporate feedback from team retrospectives
and other Agile ceremonies into your standards as part of your
continuous improvement process. That includes reviewing and analyzing
any shortcuts taken or other deviations from the standard process to
understand why it was necessary and potentially consider adapting your
standards or putting another appropriate measure in place.
>
Development teams can work most efficiently if requirements are
clearly described (e.g. in user stories), to estimate the effort and
implementation. Because of this, it is important that you choose a
tool in which these can be tracked. The Mendix platform offers a
collaborative tool called
[<u>Epics</u>](https://www.mendix.com/blog/mendix-projects-and-the-wizardry-of-epics/),
in which this is possible. Here you can manage the backlog, epics,
create user stories, and of course sprints. Both the Agile and Kanban
methods are supported.
>
An organization that is familiar with the Agile way of working will
likely already use related tools, such as JIRA. JIRA is often used for
Scrum projects, which is why it is now possible to link JIRA to your
Mendix Project. The Scrum Master of the project can choose between
Epics or Jira in the Settings part of the project navigation, in the
Project Management tab.
>
<img src="./markdown/media/image26.png"
style="width:6.5in;height:5.54531in" />
>
Make sure that the tool and process you choose supports close
collaboration between the product owner, developers, users, and other
stakeholders. The tool should enable clear visibility and tracing
between user stories, implementation, feedback, and deployments. Team
members unfamiliar with your chosen tool may also need additional
training to maximize use of the tool.

## Lecture 6.4 Defining Requirements

If at all possible, make sure the development team talks to the future
end-users — this is what sprint zero is for. The team needs to
understand what the app will be used for, what problem it is supposed
to solve, how that problem is being solved now, and what can be
improved.
>
When defining requirements, try to not take things at face value. Your
stakeholders might have a clear list of requirements, but always start
by making sure that you have a shared understanding of the problem
(this is what the part about defining application value was for). Then
look at the various ways you can help solve that problem — maybe that
first idea is not always the best one, and the way things have always
been done can be adapted for maximum efficiency.
>
Once the team has enough information, they should list the key
features and functionalities that the application will offer. This
could include data entry forms, workflow automation, reporting tools,
or any other capabilities that align with the application's purpose.
Think about what the user needs to be able to do and how. 
>
Next step is to prioritize features based on their importance to
achieving the primary goal. Remember, a minimum viable product is all
about achieving that initial value. Just because something is not a
part of that scope, does not mean it’s considered unimportant or that
it will not get done. Often things your stakeholders, or even
end-users consider crucial are things they can probably live without
for a couple of weeks. And if done right, your team will have a rhythm
that ensures they consistently continue delivering value.

## Lecture 6.5 Standard Requirements and Reusability

There will always be requirements that are repeated for each and every
application you build, things like access management or standardized
navigation, or maybe things that each app you build needs to have which
are specific to your business. If you already see things like that, note
them down and think about whether it makes sense to add them to your
standard company app template, or maybe to invest in creating a reusable
component, which will save you time in the long run. It's also ok to
move quickly for this first app and look into reusability later, some of
our most successful customers started like that!

Here is a couple of topics to keep in mind:

**End user login**

Every app will need a way for your end users to get access to it. We
advise to use the [<u>OIDC SSO
module</u>](https://docs.mendix.com/appstore/modules/oidc/) for (B2E)
apps you are developing. This is a sensible default as it is the easiest
and most flexible approach for Single Sign-On and is supported by
Microsoft’s Entra ID and most other IdPs.  As an alternative you may
advise [<u>SAML</u>](https://docs.mendix.com/appstore/modules/saml/)
(e.g. for regulated B2C-apps) or
[<u>LDAP</u>](https://docs.mendix.com/appstore/modules/ldap/) for
on-prem apps or the [<u>Forgot My
Password</u>](https://docs.mendix.com/appstore/modules/forgot-password/)
module for non-SSO apps.

**Familiarize with the Marketplace**
>
Low-code development may be fast, but using modules or content from
the Marketplace may even be faster. You may find modules relevant to
your portfolio or your first app in particular and create a shortlist
for your teams.  Marketplace content may be supported by Mendix,
Mendix partners or by the Mendix community.

## Lecture 6.6 Familiarize Yourself With Continuous Collaboration Through Mendix

One of the core values of the Mendix platform is continuous
collaboration between business and IT. We have already shown you how
that works in practice when it comes to aligning on wider strategic
objectives (your low-code vision), program goals as well as your
project goals. Now it’s time to see how it all works throughout the
application development lifecycle. 
>
<img src="./markdown/media/image27.png"
style="width:6.5in;height:3.65625in" />
>
It all starts with your portfolio. You have already added a couple of
initiatives in it, but now that you have the MVP scope of your first
application, add it in as a separate initiative and describe or link
to documentation showing what needs to be delivered exactly and why. 
>
You also have your application, so now you can link it to the
initiative. To do this, you just need to select *Edit initiative* and
start typing your app name to select it from the dropdown.
>
<img src="./markdown/media/image28.png"
style="width:6.5in;height:5.88743in" />
>
If you are using Epics as your agile planning tool, you will be able
to link the right epics to this initiative. This means that anyone who
opens that initiative in Portfolio Management will be able to see
development progress on the epic level.
>
<img src="./markdown/media/image29.png"
style="width:6.5in;height:9.48723in" />
>
Another important part of collaboration in the application development
lifecycle is the collaboration between the development team and their
end users. Mendix makes that super easy using the feedback module.
Your app users just need to click the *Feedback* button in your app
and tell you what they like, need or miss, and your development team
will be able to immediately respond. Once your app is live, the team
will be able to set up a mini-survey to ask for user satisfaction, or
get more targeted input by asking specific questions. Here you can
read more on [<u>the importance of user feedback for application
development</u>](https://www.mendix.com/blog/how-to-collect-and-analyze-user-feedback-in-your-app/).

## Lecture 6.7 The Development Process Itself and Why That’s Not a Part of This Guide

We have created this guide in order to help anyone who is in charge of
implementing Mendix in their organization to hit the ground running.
The end goal of this phase is to bring your first app to life, but if
you are working on managing the Mendix program, odds are you will not
be the person actually developing the app itself. Rather, your job is
to enable the set up of everything, focus on the 5 P’s, and empower
the development team to focus on development only. 
>
There are many dedicated resources on the platform to help new (or
seasoned developers) get the most out of Mendix.So for the sake of
your time, this guide’s length, and your sanity, let us skip a few
steps ahead and pretend that the application is now almost ready.

## Lecture 6.8 Summary

By now most probably your first application has been developed and is
ready for launch! You’ve learned how to kick off your project and have
ensured access for all stakeholders involved. You’ve also laid the
foundation for establishing an Agile way of working and made sure
there is a clear understanding of project requirements shared amongst
all stakeholders. Also, you are aware of what tools are in place to
support continuous collaboration that you can leverage through Mendix.
Time to move on and prepare for launching your first application!

# Module 7: Launching Your First Application

## Module introduction (module tile): 

You’ve come a long way, and it is time to launch your first
application. This module covers all you need to know at this stage. 

## Learning Objectives

Well done, you’ve gone a long way and learned a lot through the
process! It’s time to launch your first application. Exciting! 
>
By the end of this module, you will be able to: 

-   Identify the different options available to test your application

-   Describe the ways to promote your application

-   Recognize the importance and options to maintain and upgrade your
    application

## Lecture 7.1 Deploy Your Application

### Deploy your application to the Mendix Cloud

Deploying your application to the Mendix Cloud is a simple process,
that will give you access to all the features and services in the
Mendix Cloud. It requires only a few steps to set it up, which you
only need to do once for each application. Once the cloud settings of
your application is done, you can deploy and redeploy your application
with just one click.  

Note that Mendix also offers [other deployment
options](https://docs.mendix.com/releasenotes/developer-portal/deployment/)
than the Mendix cloud e.g. to a private cloud if that’s a requirement.

### Obtain a licensed node

You can deploy your application for free on the Mendix Cloud. These
[Free Apps have
limitations](https://docs.mendix.com/developerportal/deploy/mendix-cloud-deploy/#free-app)
when it comes to run time, features and resources. You can publish
Free Apps to test the Mendix platform, a specific feature of to
quickly prototype an application to test an idea. Once you decide to
take your application to the next-level and start serious development
on it, you will need to obtain a licensed node, so this is something
you will need to do before your launch.
>
If you have an existing contract that allows for more licensed nodes,
you can [request a new licensed
node](https://docs.mendix.com/developerportal/deploy/licensing-apps/#31-obtaining-a-licensed-node).
If you don’t have a contract, or if your contract doesn’t allow for
more licensed nodes, contact your Customer Success Manager.

### Link your application to your licensed node

If you have a licensed node available, you can link your application
to this licensed node. If your application was published as a Free
App, you will have to unlink the application from the Free App
environment first. This will delete all data on that Free App
environment. So, before you unlink your Free App, [back up the
data](https://docs.mendix.com/developerportal/deploy/licensing-apps/#backing-up)
first, if you require it.
>
If you have backed up your data, you can [unlink your
application](https://docs.mendix.com/developerportal/deploy/licensing-apps/#unlink-free)
from the Free App environment.
>
When your app is unlinked from a Free App environment, you can link it
to a licensed node. By linking it to a licensed node, you get access
to all the features of the Mendix Cloud, such as one-click deployment
from Studio Pro and our platform, log management, backups management
and monitoring tools.

### Set node permissions

Once you have linked your application to a licensed node, your team
needs to determine what users can perform what actions on the node.
Who can configure an environment, who can deploy to an environment,
who has access to the logs of an environment, etc. All of that is
controlled by [node
permissions](https://docs.mendix.com/developerportal/deploy/node-permissions/).
By default, only the Technical Contact of a node has permissions to
perform any action on the licensed node. The Technical Contact can
grant permissions to other members of the app team.
>
Granting permissions to team members is dependent on your deployment
strategy and process: do you have DevOps teams where the developers
also deploy and monitor the apps? Or does your company have separate
Ops teams, where the deployment is done by people other than the
developers? You can set node permissions for each of the environments
of your node, so you can grant developers to deploy the app to the
Test environment, but restrict deployment permissions for the
Production environment to a smaller team.

### Set cloud settings

When the node permissions are set up, you can start configuring your
cloud settings. This can be done by any team member with the correct
permissions. Changing your cloud settings is not mandatory, as most of
settings are set for you by default in the Mendix Cloud, but in some
cases you want to customize them to tailor the end user experience or
to adhere to company standards.
>
Things can you can customize for your applications in the Mendix Cloud
include:

-   [Studio Pro deployment
    target](https://docs.mendix.com/developerportal/deploy/studio-deployment-settings/#2-selecting-the-target-environment)

-   [Custom
    domains](https://docs.mendix.com/developerportal/deploy/custom-domains/)

-   [HTTP
    headers](https://docs.mendix.com/howto/security/best-practices-security/#adding-http-header)

-   [Path-based access
    restrictions](https://docs.mendix.com/developerportal/deploy/access-restrictions/)

-   [Environment
    variables](https://docs.mendix.com/developerportal/deploy/environments-details/#custom-environment-variables)

-   [Services](https://docs.mendix.com/developerportal/deploy/environments-details/#services),
    such as [the Event Broker
    service](https://docs.mendix.com/appstore/services/business-events/#mendix-event-broker)

### Deploy your application

Once you have linked and configured your Mendix Cloud node, which you
only have to do once, you can start deploying your application to the
Mendix Cloud. It is recommended that you deploy any new version of
your application to the Test or Acceptance environment of your
application first for testing, before deploying it to the Production
environment.
>
There are multiple ways to deploy your application to the Mendix
Cloud, so there is always a deployment flow that fits your needs. You
(or your team) can get a complete overview of those [in this docs
page](https://docs.mendix.com/developerportal/deploy/mendix-cloud-deploy/#deploy-app-mendix-cloud).

## Lecture 7.2 Test Your Application

Mendix has a module that allows developers to write and execute Unit
Tests: the UnitTesting module in Marketplace. With the UnitTesting
module, critical parts of the application can be tested.
>
There are a variety of tools available for testing, from
Mendix-supported ones to third-party ones. Read more about [Test
Automation and Quality
Assurance](https://www.mendix.com/evaluation-guide/app-lifecycle/test-automation-quality-assurance/).
>
Aside from unit tests, performance tests can also be performed with
multiple third-party tools, such as JMeter, BlazeMeter and LoadRunner
– all of which are capable of testing the performance of your Mendix
application.
>
After go-live, the Mendix Cloud offers metrics and logs to provide
insights into application performance and can help track down bugs.

## Lecture 7.3 User Acceptance Testing

Before launching your first application, it is important to thoroughly
test the application, not just in terms of bug bashing, but also to
make sure it fulfills end user needs. That is why User Acceptance
Tests should be performed before any go-live. What does that mean?
It’s simple — always get your end users to actually try out the app
before the go-live. This will give you the chance to catch any
last-minute bugs and make sure your app is meeting (and exceeding)
user expectations. 
>
Mendix feedback module makes it super easy to organize user acceptance
tests, all you need to do is to select the environment you want to do
this in, make sure the feedback module is set up there, inform your
end-users that you need their help and give them information on how to
log in and how to provide feedback (maybe you want them to test
specific scenarios you would give them on advance, or just let them
play around themselves and give feedback on anything they notice might
need to be changed). Then your development team will be able to fix
any issues and respond to questions that might arise. Keep in mind
that they might need extra time to tackle this feedback, so be sure
you get user input at least a week before your planned go live date,
preferably even longer. 

## Lecture 7.4 Launch and Promote Your Application

Congratulations! If you made it this far, you’ve most likely launched
your first Mendix app and have already started delivering value for
your organization. You’ve probably tried doing things a bit
differently than before and your team, as well as your whole
organization, learned a lot along the way. To ensure continued
success, here are a couple of things you need to think about now.
>
**Celebrate your first launch**
>
Yes, you absolutely need to celebrate. Here are some tips to maximize
the impact of your internal celebration: 

-   Throw a party and invite as many people as possible, not just your
    development team. 

-   Host the party in a central location so that other departments take
    notice. 

-   People love cake. To be more specific: people love free cake. Order
    a cake. One of our customers in the shipping industry made their
    cake look like a shipping container because their app increased the
    utilization of their containers. You could make your cake look like
    a volcano, because business is about to erupt. 

-   Make sure your most senior sponsor is in the room to reinforce the
    importance of low-code development. 

-   Captivate your audience by presenting the astonishing results of
    your project. Have the business show the demo.

-   Here’s who you can consider inviting to celebrate with you: 

    -   Project team

    -   Business stakeholders 

    -   Stakeholders from other lines of business

    -   IT leaders

    -   Mendix Expert Services or the Partner that helped guide the team
        through the project

But it doesn’t stop there. You need to continue talking about your
first success. This part might feel like shameless promotion, and it
might not come naturally to you or your team, but trust us, it’s vital
and it works. Some of our most successful customers went on to share
their success story in the form of a blog for your company website or
intranet, a video, a podcast or at the very least a value one-pager
that can be shared across your organization. Trust us, it’s worth it.

## Lecture 7.5 After the Launch

**Establish a retrospective cadence **
>
To achieve this milestone, it’s first important to establish the goals
of a retrospective. The retrospective should look back on the project
and review successes and lessons learned. 

1.  Did the project achieve its business goal? 

2.  Did you have the right people on the team? 

3.  How well was the business engaged in the process? 

Embrace all feedback, whether it’s perception or reality. Again, let
the business know they have a voice and that their input is vital to
improving future projects. Seek their advice on how to develop a more
structured rapid application development approach that further
enhances engagement and collaboration with other business units.
>
One of the most important questions to ask the business stakeholders
in the retrospective is “What would you tell your friends/colleagues
about this project to make them enthusiastic?” This elevator pitch is
great fodder for internal feedback, with the goal of implementing this
approach more broadly across the organization. To effectively engage
the business, you may have to reverse years of perception. The key is
constant communication and proof. Once business users see that you
have done what you said you would do — and that they can have a
significant impact on the project —they will quickly embrace this new
approach
>
Make sure to do a team retrospective as well, these are some of the
points you can consider:

-   What went well?

-   What didn’t go well? 

-   Who really excelled in the project and can take on the Mendix
    developer lead role/advance their certification level?

-   How can you use this information to refine your process for the next
    project?

**Document and measure the value of the application** 
>
Remember those goals you outlined when you initially defined the value
of your application? Now is the time to go back to them and see if you
have reached them or are on track to reach them.
>
It might take a bit of time to capture enough data to be able to draw
conclusions, but always make sure the value the app brought about is
captured. This might include things like generating additional revenue
or maybe saving costs by sunsetting existing legacy apps, automating
previously manual processes, or simply delivering a new application
faster than you would with traditional development. It could even be
something like improving your customer satisfaction or engagement.
Whatever it is, make sure you have measured it and will continue to
measure it. This will also be important when the time comes for you to
define the value of your second and third app.

## Lecture 7.6 Maintain and Upgrade Your Applications

**Platform: Maintaining your Mendix App**
>
After developing and publishing your first Mendix app, it's important
to put proper maintenance measures in place. [<u>Establishing a
regular upgrade
practice</u>](https://www.mendix.com/wp-content/uploads/Your-Mendix-Upgrade-Guide-1.pdf)
<u>\[DB37\]</u<u>\[UT38\]</uwill help keep your app up to date
with support and retain access to the latest features.
>
Mendix supports three major versions at a time. For example, today
Mendix supports major versions 8, 9, and 10. When the next version
(11) is released, then version 8 will sunset, and versions 9, 10, and
11 will be supported.

Learn more about [version details and release
timelines](https://docs.mendix.com/releasenotes/studio-pro/lts-mts/#major-version).

## Lecture 7.7 Summary
