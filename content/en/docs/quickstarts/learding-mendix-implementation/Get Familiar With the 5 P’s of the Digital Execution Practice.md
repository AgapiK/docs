## Lecture 2.1 Assign Your Mendix Admin

First let’s get one admin (no pun intended) thing out of the way. Your
company needs **at least one Admin**. It might make sense for the
first admin to be you and then you can easily assign as many other
admins as you need.

>So why do you need an admin? Your developers are able to create new
>apps, invite other users to their app teams, deploy apps, and invite
>app end-users to give feedback, among many other activities. Insights
>into these company activities are provided in [<u>Control
>Center</u>](https://controlcenter.mendix.com/index.html) in one
>central overview. You can read more about Control Center
>[<u>here</u>](https://docs.mendix.com/control-center/) or follow this
>[<u>learning
>path. </u>](https://academy.mendix.com/link/paths/116/Govern-and-Scale-your-App-Landscape-with-Mendix-Control-Center)
>
>Do you already have at least one admin? If that’s the case, you can
>see them on the list when you open [<u>Control
>Center</u>](https://controlcenter.mendix.com/index.html), and you can
>skip the rest of this lecture.
>
>A **Mendix Admin** will normally be someone in the IT department of
>your company, and they will have full access to Control Center, which
>will give them visibility and essential controls to make sure the apps
>deliver business value at acceptable cost and risk.  You can assign
>your first Mendix Admin through [<u>Mendix
>Support</u>](https://support.mendix.com/hc/en-us/requests/new), just
>choose "Standard Change: Assign Mendix Admin" from the dropdown. This
>first admin can then [<u>add other
>admins</u>](https://docs.mendix.com/control-center/company-settings/#3-mendix-admins).

## Lecture 2.3 Introduction to Digital Execution Practice (DEP): the 3 S’s and the 5 P’s

**The 3 S’s of Digital Execution Practice: Start, Structure and
Scale**

>Your journey to innovation will go through three major stages:
>**Start**, **Structure** and **Scale**. You are now in the **Start**
>stage, where the goal is to lay the foundations for your innovation
>factory. In Start, you want to develop applications that realize value
>quickly. The reason for this is two-fold:

1.  You’ll be spending a lot of time building a team and putting the
    necessary prerequisites in place in terms of infrastructure and
    process. Because of that... 

2.  You want quick wins. Quick wins are important because you’ll use
    these to prove the value of your new approach. Celebrating your
    first success will help you gain broader support around the company.

If the Start stage is about establishing and proving the benefits of
rapid application development, then **Structure** is about building
out predictability and continuity. Structure is about growing from
your first set of apps to a portfolio with a diverse array of apps
addressing multiple use cases, expanding your first team into multiple
teams, and expanding your developer center. 

>Structure is about taking the process of your first agile experience
>that you established in Start to a process that institutes shorter
>release cycles under strict governance. Structure is where you begin
>to formalize your rapid application development process — establishing
>an architecture, enabling continuous delivery, and creating
>governance. By establishing predictability and stability, you’re
>building the scaffolding for future successes.
>
>In **Scale**, you have learned how to use Mendix to speed up and scale
>out app development and start delivering real value for your business.
>Your talent has been trained and activated in such a way that you can
>shift them around the organization to work on projects where their
>skills are best put to use. You are applying greater automation to
>your processes to efficiently and rapidly deliver and manage hundreds
>of applications with strategic impact. This includes automating
>deployment and maintenance to support a large portfolio, automating
>quality assurance to proactively monitor the maintainability of your
>projects, and enabling greater reusability by establishing a private
>app store. With these capabilities in place, you maximize value and
>productivity by creating distributed innovation capabilities
>throughout the enterprise. You have achieved continuous productivity
>and efficiency.
>
>**The 5 P’s of Digital Transformation**
>
>Sounds great, right? But how do you get there? Step by step. There are
>five major areas you will need to focus on. We call these the **5 P’s
>of Digital Transformation** and aligning the P’s (Portfolio, People,
>Process, Platform, and Promotion) to your organization's digital
>strategy is crucial to your Mendix success. Let’s go over them one by
>one.
>

>style="width:6.5in;height:3.53438in" />

## 2.3.1 Portfolio: Choosing a Use Case That Is Equally Meaningful and Doable

Getting your digital transformation program off the ground starts with
identifying the right projects and creating an application portfolio
of quick wins in high-value initiatives.

>Why quick wins?
>
>Proving the value of a program—whether it’s through software that
>allows your business to create a new channel of revenue or an
>application that saves employees time on an internal process—allows
>you to realize immediate success and justify a broader organizational
>change. A diversity of use cases is important here, to show that your
>application portfolio can reach many different departments and address
>a variety of needs.
>
>And guess what? We have a tool to help you with that. Mendix Portfolio
>Management gives you a way to identify, track, and plan out your
>initiatives. So, let's get started by creating your Portfolio board
>[<u>here</u>](https://portfolio.mendix.com/index.html). All you need
>to do is click on *Get Started* and then *Create your first
>Portfolio*. 
>
><img src="./markdown/media/image5.png"
>style="width:6.5in;height:3.15859in" />
>
>If you would like to learn more about how to manage your portfolio of
>ideas and applications, . You might also have done a portfolio
>workshop with Mendix experts before, in which case, you may already
>have an Excel file with your list of initiatives that you can easily
>import into your brand new board. If not, we discuss your first app
>selection in more detail in Module 3.

## 2.3.2 People: Building a Strong Mendix Team

The people you choose for your teams are absolutely crucial to the
success of your digital execution program. You want to find the right
people with the right skills who are excited about and can commit time
and energy to the program, no matter their job title. 

 

A strong first Mendix team is more than just the number of people in
the room. Your first Mendix team should include a core development
team comprised of a combination of a professional developer — someone
with technical expertise — and a business developer — someone familiar
with the platform that can act as a power user if needed. The key is
to have developers who can collaborate closely with end users,
bridging the gap between business needs and technical possibilities.
In the beginning, it’s highly likely that not all these people will
come from your own organization (we will further review the options in
Lecture 3.7), but this is an overview of all the higher level roles
you will need sooner or later.

>The following leadership roles are essential to the success of any new
>platform or paradigm:

-   **Executive Sponsors:** Success starts at the top, where senior
    executive buy-in is a must. These are the top-level executives,
    ideally representing both the Business/Operations and IT, who are
    willing to be engaged periodically to provide oversight and
    steering-committee level guidance. These people won’t necessarily be
    involved day-to-day, but they understand the big picture vision of
    how Mendix will help the enterprise achieve its digital
    transformation and low-code goals, how it fits to ‘play nicely’ with
    other technology stacks and tools like Microsoft’s ADO or Power
    Apps, and what the transformational value is expected. Your Mendix
    team can work with these individuals to help understand, define, and
    refine their role, the value proposition for high ROI, etc.

<!-- -->

-   **Program Owner:**  You need a person to lead the program and
    mandate/enable change; who generates excitement about the importance
    of this transformation and can inspire people to *want* to
    participate. This person is directly responsible for the overall
    success of the platform’s implementation, bringing impactful apps to
    fruition, ensuring value targets are defined and tracked, and that
    the teams are properly assigned and allocated for success. 

It’s common for Program Owners to work very closely with their Mendix
CSMs to define and implement success plans and to evolve those plans
over time to ensure ever-increasing returns and solid value. For
smaller organizations, this person may also be part of the Core Team;
for larger organizations, it’s common for this person to be a part of
the Center of Excellence leadership team or to be a dedicated senior
resource overseeing global success. Areas of responsibility include
assurance of proper architectural and governance guidelines/adherence,
successful regional and global rollouts, successful team
growth/training/enablement plans, KPI definition and tracking, etc.  

-   **Center of Excellence Lead (COE Lead):** Generally, larger
    organizations implement a Mendix COE to help define and enforce good
    governance, development, and enablement practices that can evolve
    with the business and technological changes for overall platform and
    program success throughout the enterprise over time. The COE Lead
    ensures the Mendix COE is properly staffed to support, oversee and
    enable development teams, and ensures the products produced are of
    high-quality following best practices for high re-usability,
    maintainability and return on investment. This person generally has
    sufficient senior-level technical and managerial skills to oversee
    the COE’s Enterprise and Solution Architects, DevOps technical
    leads, trainers and mentors, and other experienced staff.

**Product owners** are key players to a successful program, because
they’ll have in-depth knowledge of the business, the product, and its
users, and will have insight into the value that it will create. If
possible, make sure that your first product owner comes from your own
organization and is familiar with the problem you are setting out to
solve with your first application. Product owner is not really a
leadership role, but the choice of a product owner is crucial for the
success of your first app, which is why we touch on it here. can POs
are also a part of the agile scrum team, so we will mention them again
in section 4.2.

>**Architects** will help establish a target architecture,
>infrastructure, and governance. 
>
>Finally, an **application development manager** needs to spearhead the
>initiative and drive the program and the cross-functional teams who
>will deliver on those projects. 
>
>**The blueprint to build your first Mendix team**
>
>We’ve created the blueprint for building your first Mendix team,
>assessing that team, and showing how it can grow and collaborate with
>the business and other departments within your organization. 
>
>**Find problem solvers** 
>
>Find team members who care about solving business problems rather than
>people who prefer to build solutions based on detailed requirements.
>There will be many obstacles to overcome due to existing processes and
>the culture of the business, so seek out people who have a “can-do”
>attitude who can be change evangelists. 
>
>Traditional developers (with experience in programming languages such
>as C#, Python, Java, etc.) are usually very quick to grasp Mendix as
>well. Here you might want to look for people who are more
>outcome-oriented and love adding new tools to their toolbox.
>
>That said, don’t get too hung up on job roles — you also need people
>who want to test their limit and have some technical proficiency, but
>also understand business challenges. A host of individuals that we’ve
>seen successfully make the transition come from business analysis, UX,
>front-end web design, and business intelligence backgrounds. 
>
>In the end, selecting the right team and arming them for success is
>the cornerstone of success, not just for your first project but for
>your entire rapid application development program. 
>
>**A who’s who** 
>
>It’s important to keep your team small as you build your Mendix Center
>of Excellence (your central repository of development expertise,
>reusable components, and governance guidance that business teams can
>access as they build their specialized solutions). With a small team,
>you can deliver new applications quickly, avoiding much of the
>miscommunication and delays that often come with larger development
>teams. Smaller teams encourage productivity and creativity. Amazon CEO
>Jeff Bezos’ “two pizza rule” states that you should never have a
>meeting where two pizzas couldn’t feed the entire group. The smaller
>the team, the more room for brainstorming and peer review. 
>
>**Mendix developers come with all types of skill-sets** 
>
>Developers come from all parts of the business, not just IT. From your
>high-code programmers, to your business-centric developers, to your
>tech-savvy business analysts, low-code platforms let you build teams
>of makers from all backgrounds. 
>
>As the main action point here, start thinking about who you need to
>kick off building your first Mendix application and start talking to
>them about it. Some names are probably coming to mind already and you
>will get much more information on who you need exactly in **Lecture
>4.2 Identify Your First Mendix Project Team**.

## 2.3.3 Process: Building Repeatable Practices for Long-Term Outcomes

Successful digital execution means changing the way you work and
establishing rapid application development processes. Agile
methodologies like Scrum are a good starting point, splitting the work
into sprints and basing them off user stories, but you also need to
change from a traditional way of development and operations into a
BizDevOps approach, which promotes close collaboration and shared
knowledge between the business team, developers, and operational team.
It ditches the division between those departments to get rid of
unnecessary knowledge silos that only disrupt the information flow.

>**Minimum Viable Product**
>
>One important concept to embrace for your process (if you haven’t
>already) is the **Minimum Viable Product (MVP)**. MVP is a version of
>an application with just enough features to be usable by early
>customers who can then provide feedback for future development. 
>
>Minimum viable products are meant to be incomplete by nature, with the
>goal of delivering value quickly, then figuring out next requirements
>and iterating on them based on the input from actual users. This
>ensures that the application will provide the right user experience
>and achieve the goals you set. It is easier said than done, though,
>and the change in the way of working takes a bit of time to get used
>to. If you haven’t involved your end users into the process before, it
>may feel like an extra task that is slowing you down but trust the
>process — getting their input early on will save you many costly
>changes down the road. And just because something is not a part of the
>MVP, does not mean it won’t be delivered just a couple of days or
>weeks later, since this way of working enables lighting fast
>iterations!
>
>**Put a governance structure in place** 
>
>A core element to success is repeating it. Repeated success leads to
>and informs your governance around rapid application development. You
>need to define and implement processes and rules around application
>development that help you coordinate and control your application
>portfolio. 
>
>Governance is creating a centralized hub where you establish best
>practices around agile and scrum, UI/UX, and guidelines around build,
>deployment, and architecture as well as security/compliance. You’re
>assigning the people on your team responsibilities around these best
>practices. 

## 2.3.4 Platform: Tying All These Pieces Together With a Pure Low-Code Platform

As you hurtle towards digital execution, the Rapid Application
Development platform you choose shouldn’t just be about new technology
trends, like Artificial Intelligence, Big Data, or Blockchain, or
whatever comes down the line. You need a platform that also helps you
improve operational efficiency, reduce time-to-market, and foster
collaboration between Business and IT. Something that addresses the
present and prepares you for the future. Seek out a platform that
helps you not only deliver faster, but more accurately, so that you
can produce robust applications in a matter of weeks.

>Mendix is a platform specifically built to tie all these pieces
>together and enable enterprises to get things done quickly as well as
>allow your teams and technology ecosystem to evolve and embrace the
>different technologies that will come along.
>
>**High-level positioning** 
>
>High-level positioning is about knowing how and where Mendix fits in
>with the rest of your IT ecosystem. Use the Start stage to experience
>the benefits of instant provisioning, not just of the application
>environment, but all the software needed to support the entire
>lifecycle, from project management to repositories. Learning more
>about how easy it should be to deploy and operate apps shows how
>developers can do this themselves and helps your innovation factory
>achieve continuous productivity and efficiency. 
>
>**Deployment strategy** 
>
>The Start stage is an excellent time to start exploring your cloud
>options, and use this knowledge as input for strategic choices in the
>future. You’re most likely going to deploy your application on the
>Mendix Cloud because it’s the most optimized cloud to run Mendix-built
>applications. Built on top of Cloud Foundry and AWS, the Mendix Cloud
>is the deployment solution in which Mendix provides hosting
>environments for you. It’s available globally and comes standard with
>deep insights, alerting capabilities, high availability options, and
>backups. 
>
><img src="./markdown/media/image6.png"
>style="width:6.5in;height:1.64544in" />
>
>But as you expand your portfolio and move from Start to Structure, you
>will need to consider other deployment options and moving to a
>multi-cloud environment. Understanding the cloud environments to which
>you’ll deploy—for example, the security features and how they fit into
>your existing security framework—will help inform how you move to
>Structure. 
>
>**Data and integration strategy** 
>
>Similar to your deployment strategy, you also want to begin
>considering what your data and integration strategy looks like with
>Mendix as a part of your overall technology ecosystem. You need to
>consider your architecture strategy, too. This is an opportunity for
>that vanguard architect you elected to come in and understand what
>architecture works best for your development program. 

## 2.3.5 Promotion: Showcasing Your Successes and How They Connect to Your Strategy

We’ve all heard the saying, “If a tree falls in the forest but no one
is around to hear it, does it make any sound?” Similarly, if you are
excellent at the core components of digital transformation but don’t
communicate it to anyone, does it really have an impact? That is where
promotion comes into play. Without promotion, success can go
unnoticed, and the value of your efforts may not be recognized.
Promotion tends to be a challenge for many IT organizations, in part
because IT teams do not often have professional marketers. Even
without a marketing team behind you, here are five ways you can better
promote the value of low-code within your organization. 

>***Shaping and communicating your low-code vision:** *We’ll help you
>solidify your low-code vision later in this learning path, but once
>you have it, don’t let it live on a shelf or in the cloud — allow it
>to evolve with input from your organization. Communicate your vision
>in cross-functional meetings and ask for support in getting
>organizational leadership to embed the vision into their message as
>well. 
>
>***Stakeholder management:*** Involve stakeholders early and often to
>build enthusiasm for digital transformation success. Start by bringing
>cross-functional partners on board who you already have strong
>relationships with, and work together to identify the problems you
>want to solve. By building a plan together you can help ensure your
>initiatives will get support. 
>
>***Internal PR:*** Build a plan for how you will raise awareness and
>involvement in your low-code implementation and ensure your executive
>sponsor helps your PR efforts. You can leverage existing communication
>channels such as company meetings, newsletters, or shared
>collaboration sites to spread your message. Start by sharing your plan
>and vision, and then use these channels to celebrate success after
>your first go-live.  
>
>***Community building:*** Digital transformation is all about bringing
>together business and IT. Start with a portfolio workshop to
>brainstorm ideas for your first application, and then identify teams
>who will collaborate through implementation and launch. Identify a
>core group of champions who can raise awareness on your behalf even
>when you aren’t in the room. 
>
>***Celebrating success:*** We love a good reason to celebrate, and
>hope you’ll use milestones large and small to celebrate your
>successes. Acknowledging your achievements, whether it’s getting the
>team to complete Academy certifications, building the first reusable
>component, finishing the first development sprint or launching your
>first application, celebrations are a powerful way to boost team
>morale and drive future momentum.
